         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE graces of Selfe-deniall and Faith, are like thoſe two pillars of <hi>Iachin</hi> and <hi>Boaz,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 3.17.</note> erected at the beautifull entrance into the Temple for all men to caſt their eyes upon, and that worthily; for moſt coſtly and pretious was their matter, and moſt curious and artificiall was their workemanſhip. For, as thoſe two Pillars led the way into a glorious Temple, yet made with hands; ſo doe theſe two ſtand in the porch of a better Temple, even that of Grace here, and Glory eternall in the heavens: And as they ſo ſtood neare the gate of entrance that no man could enter in, ſave by them, although themſelves never went in but alway ſtaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; ſo theſe graces though they ſhall leave the ſoule in Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe ſhould not need them, yet they ſhall not forſake her while ſhe abides in the porch, but ſhut heaven doore upon her ere they take their leave. Moreover as the contriver and erecter of the former was that famous and cunning Artiſt, <hi>Hyram</hi> of <hi>Tyre:</hi> ſo,<note place="margin">1 King. 7.13.</note> no leſſe an artificer then <hi>Hyram</hi> (nay a greater then <hi>Hyram</hi> is here) I ſay, the Spirit of the Lord Ieſus is the framer and ſetter up of theſe in the Soules of Gods Elect. And theſe two graces (good <hi>Madam</hi>) with the diſcovery thereof, are the chiefe frame of theſe my enſuing Lectures; in which, both when I preached them, and now I write them, I aime at this marke, to withdraw the ſoule from the life of it owne hand, to the life of the Lord Ieſus,<note place="margin">Eſay 57.9.</note> and from an
<pb facs="tcp:45715:3"/> empty Religion to be acquainted with the myſteries of the Goſpell, the only manuduction to true godlineſſe. All profeſsion being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, ſave a ſhadow, and bottomleſſe building, which is not grounded and quickned with Selfe-deniall and Faith.</p>
            <p>And indeed <hi>(Right Honourable)</hi> if ever any age of the Church did, then doth this in which we live, in my judgement, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that the labours of us Miniſters, be improved about the urging of theſe; whether we looke upon the times, or turne our eyes to God himſelfe in his adminiſtration and government; we ſhall obſerve the former exceſsively overgrowne with an outward and formall Religion; and for the latter, when did the Lord ſo eſtrange himſelf from us, and dwell as it were, in the midſt of a thicke cloud: So that, except by the lively practice of theſe two graces, we do not ſtir up our ſelves to take hould of him, how can our lives chuze but be ſad and comfortleſſe? Surely, if ever, we had now need, to preaſe upon more familiar acquaintance with God in all his graces, and (as <hi>David</hi> did) to view his Temple well.</p>
            <p>True it is, that the old Iew, had little knowledge of God, ſave by the name of Iehova, Alſufficient, and a generall aime at the promiſe of a Meſsia, the bleſſed ſeed to come. Doubtleſſe, they lived at poore termes: It was enough for them to caſt an eye upon Gods Temple, as <hi>Daniel</hi> in captivity, and <hi>Iona</hi> in the Whales belly might do;<note place="margin">Dan. 6.10. Jona 2 7.</note> Strange and deep was that mercy which would ſo far off behold ſuch, as ſo far off beheld him; but now we, the Church of the New Teſtament are come nearer to God,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.24.</note> we are come to mount Sion, to the heavenly Ieruſalem, to the Church of the firſt born, to Ieſus himſelf the Mediator of the Covenant, and the bloud of ſprinkling, which ſpeakes better things then that of <hi>Abel.</hi> We are come now beyond the Porch and Sanctuary, even to the Holy of Holies, through his fleſh, that hath broken downe the vaile of ſeperation. So that now we are paſt viewing of the Temple well, for we had need become this Temple our ſelves;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.18.</note> Whoſe corner ſtone is precious Ieſus, and wee precious ſtones built upon him, and riſing up daily to a more lively and well proportioned building.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.5.</note> A little taſte of the gift of God, a few good reaches and affections after holineſſe are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for us, but to be grounded upon theſe foundations of Selfe-deniall and Faith,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 11.1.</note> which promiſe us an open entrance into that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Temple. According therefore to thoſe talents of Wiſdome and
<pb facs="tcp:45715:3"/> Knowledge which the Lord hath long imparted to us by the bleſſed lights of his Miniſters (who ſometimes ſhined in our Sphere, but now in glory it is expected at our hands, That we comprehend with all Saints that depth and breadth of love which is in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Eph. 3.17 18.</note> that he may dwell in our hearts by faith,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.1.</note> &amp; that (forgetting our firſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) we ſtrive toward perfection ſo far as in this vaile of miſery its poſsible to reach to. I know your Honour hath long made this your marke; and that leaving things behinde, you have long looked forward to the prize of the high calling of God,<note place="margin">Phil 3.13.</note> and to that end have I ſent you this Booke, that it may affoord you ſome ſuccour and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection hereto in your private condition, and ſad widowhood.

And firſt, Self is taken in a good conſtruction for that appetite of the ſoule,<note place="margin">Pure Selfe.</note> conſidered in her pure naturals, and in this ſenſe, its nothings elſe, ſave the deſire of the whole man in her ſeverall faculties, naturall, ſenſible and reaſonable, to maintaine and preſerve it ſelfe in the integrity of her eſtate. And thus each creature (not man alone) hath an inſtinct planted in it by God, to affect and enſue the meanes of it owne ſafety and ſupport (as that Orator ſpeakes) in which reſpect, its ſtiled by this name of Selfe, not becauſe its the whole being of the creature, but a faculty neerly touching the ſuſtaining of her particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Plants, Beaſts, have this diſpoſition to ſavour what is for them, to ſhunne what is againſt them; much more man. It was a peece of <hi>Adams</hi> wiſdome and perfection, and ſtill would be in us, as it was in him, blameleſſe, if ſomewhat had not come betweene. Its the ſame whereof <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, No man ever hated his owne fleſh, but nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and cheriſhed it: Now the contrary to this Selfe, is Self-deniall; which although it is of all other the eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt grace in other reſpects, yet in this, is the moſt eminent vice, for what is ſo hideous as for a man to throw off na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and deny it the due meanes of life, health and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? Even an unaturall cruelty, and worſe then to maligne or hurt another: yea this Selfe-love is ſo good, that its the ſtandard of all offices of love concerning our neighbour, Doe as you would be done to: Thou ſhalt love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelfe. And were not this ſinleſſe, the holy Ghoſt ſhould teach us to be mercenaries, by perſwading us to obedience by ſo many arguments taken from our ſelves, cloathing grace in the colours of gaine, ſafety, health to our navill, marrow to our bones, good name, long life, and the like.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>2</label> But this is not the Selfe we meane. Selfe therefore in a
<pb facs="tcp:45715:5"/> ſecond difference, is that which is called corrupt Selfe.<note place="margin">Corrupt Selfe in generall.</note> And its no other, ſave the bad Selfe, of good Selfe, an ill quality cleaving to a good ſubject. In this ſenſe it is (upon point) no other then old <hi>Adam;</hi> the depravedneſſe and diſorder of the appetite before ſpoken of. As the wildeneſſe of an horſe, or his lameneſſe are accidentall to his good metall and good pace: even ſo, that faculty whereby I naturally ſeeke mine owne welfare and ſafety is good: But the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order thereof, whereby I ſeeke my ſelfe corruptly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly is accidentall thereto, and ſeparable from it by grace. In Scripture, this is called fleſh, luſt, and ſometime (by a metonymie of the ſubject for the adjunct) Selfe; to ſhew the inwardneſſe and rooted familiarity of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to nature. So <hi>Iob</hi> 42. <hi>I abhorre my ſelfe in duſt and aſhes.</hi> So <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Of myſelfe I will not boaſt.</hi> And, if I preach my ſelfe, that is my corrupt ſelfe: <hi>Adam</hi> was ſo created, that God was his appetite, the deſire of his ſoule was to him onely as the chiefe good, and his owne happineſſe, further or elſewhere he ſought not: Him he truſted to, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, obeyed and embraced with his whole man. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had deſerted God, he juſtly was deſerted of him to ſeeke after an imaginary happineſſe, falling downe (by the penalty of Selfe) to a denied apple, and thereby given over to the creature, to grope therein after a welfare, ever cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, never obtained. Still the ſubject nature remained to ſeek himſelf; but that directive of minde, and freedome of pure will that kept him before, now being gone, he was changed into a corrupt Self-ſeeking and Selfe-love. As it fares with him that ſtrives to behold the bright body of the Sun (but by reaſon of weak eies) cannot, dazles and flags downeward, and thinkes he ſees three Sunnes for one, but in truth ſees none: So the ſoule ſunke down from God by wilfull deſertion, and not being able any longer to behold the excellency that is in him, falls downe and adores a falſe Trinity, the luſt of the heart, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life, the vaine curſed creature (that hath nothing in it equalling the ſoule) inſtead of God. Selfe then in this ſenſe is nothing elſe, ſave corruption and originall ſinne.
<pb facs="tcp:45715:6"/> Contrary to this Selfe is Selfe-deniall in a good ſenſe, which to ſpeake properly, is nothing elſe ſave Regeneration, whereby the ſoule generally denies corrupt Selfe in her frame and ſtreame, bending a contrary way; forſaking the creature, and returning to God, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.8. her firſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and making him really that unto her, which corrupt Selfe erroneouſly was; That is herſelfe, and herſelfe his, to ſeeke his ends and felicitie therein, renouncing her owne. In this ſenſe, Divines ſpeake and write, when they treat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſtate of Vnregeneracy or Apoſtacy from God, and to this head, referre all thoſe markes, ſignes and degrees, whereby Selfe may be diſcovered: Alſo, to this referre all that is uſually diſcourſed touching converſion of the ſoule to God, and turning herſelfe, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. from her vaine Idolls and darkeneſſe, to the living God. All is no other in a word, ſave ſetting the ſoul ſtreight to her firſt object, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Selfe and obliquity thereof: when fleſhly wiſdome of the minde, and carnall favour of the heart, is turned to the wiſdome of God to ſalvation, and the ſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it freely and ſweetly, then is this great cure wrought. This of the ſecond.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>3</label> But all this while, I have ſpoken of corrupt Self generally conſidered and apart.<note place="margin">Selfe in the remedy.</note> But herein yet, appeares not her own venom; while ſhe is let alone, ſhe is ſtill and quiet, as a ſnake in her hole, being no whit leſſe herſelfe, I grant, but yet not apearing in her right colours.<note place="margin">1. In the Law.</note> Selfe in the remedy, is the true corrupt Selfe; when God ſends her in a light to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all her filth, to convince, to tame her, and fetch her home, then ſhe ſhewes the metall ſhe is made of, and then it appeares, it was hell fire that kindled this heat in her, and bred this monſter of privation and enmity to God. (Marke well what I ſay, all you that thinke originall ſinne a bug-beare) when the Law came, fire revived, it was dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; luſt was unknowne till the Law ſaid, Thou ſhalt not luſt. But as the Toad being prickt ſpits poiſon: So Selfe encountred with a Law, proves out of meaſure ſinfull, and rebelliouſly daſhes herſelf againſt it as a pitcher againſt a ſtone wall: to this kinde, referre all that rebellion of Selfe
<pb facs="tcp:45715:6"/> againſt the word of conviction; and that ſly-ſelfe which chuſes to ſcrue herſelfe into the deepeſt bondage and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror that may be, rather then ſhee will come to the bent of Gods bow, that is, loſe her life and proud ſpirit upon the pikes of wrath, which is the onely way which God hath appointed, to wit, when ſhe is wholy broken in peeces up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this wheele and come to an utter ſtrait, then to ſhew her a doore of hope: of this, it ſhall be ſufficient to ſpeake but a word, ſince I have largely treated of it in her due place.</p>
            <p>But legall Selfe is not the deepeſt poiſon of Selfe:<note place="margin">But eſpecially in the Goſpel.</note> The worke of the Law is but a remote remedy: The Goſpell is that neare object which above all other diſcovers Selfe in her kinde: The cloſer the Goſpell and Chriſt come to the ſoule, the more oppoſite is Selfe; and as Faith is the moſt eminently ſpirituall grace above all graces; ſo is Selfe the deepeſt deadlieſt enemy to it of all other, yea to whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſavours of it, any promiſe, any offer of mercy, any work of Chriſt in the ſoule, any preparation making that way: Selfe was jealous of the Law, leſt ſhe be diſpoſſeſſed: But infinitely more jealous of Chriſt, leſt he take new poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Its the moſt uncouth, deſolate object unto her, to thinke of giving up herſelf to Chriſt, and leaving her old hold, that can be imagined. Hence come thoſe infinite, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſubtill and deſperate feares, doubts, impoſſibilities, difficulties, objections againſt the promiſe in the rebellious, thoſe invincible ſnares of ill conſcience accuſtomed to ſin, that ſo great a ſinner, ſo unworthy a wretch, ſhould ever ſpeed of favour from ſo potent a God, ſo juſt and terrible a Judge. And hence is it alſo, that not onely Selfe is ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the wicked: But, when a ſoule is got under a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of mercy, yet then Selfe wraps ſuch a world of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt her owne particular beleeving. Hence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it is, that, rather then ſhe will be caſt out, ſhee will put herſelfe upon the promiſe oftimes with ſelf-preſumption, reſting in her falſe hopes, duties, performances, affections, preparations, and the like, but all to deceive herſelfe, and by ſeeming ſelf-deniall, to twine, as the Ivy about the oake,
<pb facs="tcp:45715:7"/> for her owne ends, that by mixing herſelfe with Chriſt, ſhe might ſtill grow from her owne roote, and reſt in her bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, that ſo not Chriſt, but Selfe might be all in all; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this Selfe, is Selfe-deniall, the laſt and ſureſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of the ſoule to Chriſt; for although all be good, yet none ſo ſure as this; this being added to the reſt, argues a ſpirit of ſaving grace to be at worke, and making way for Chriſt to caſt out this ſtrong man, and take poſſeſſion in the ſoule. And of this Selfe, and her oppoſite deniall of Selfe, I doe chiefly treat in this Treatiſe following, as thou ſhalt ſee at thy leaſure, although perhaps I trench upon Self, by the way, in other reſpects. And ſo much for this third ſenſe.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>4</label> Yet a fourth and laſt difference remaines, that is, Selfe in ſanctification.<note place="margin">Selfe in ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> For whether we ſpeake of hypocrites, who deceive themſelves in an opinion of it (when as alas they are farre from it!) and in a perſwaſion of their faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have ſome ſeeming fruits of a change, whereas they never came within the liſts of converſion either by Law or Goſpel, and therefore walke in a covenant of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall workes, abſtinences and performances: Or whether we ſpeake of the truly ſanctified, even they may miſtake the worke of ſanctification in themſelves when they turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, reſting upon workes, without claſping and cleaving to their principle in all their courſe: I ſay, Selfe is not ſo quite defaced in a beleeving ſoule it ſelfe, but that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of old dregs unmortified ſtill remaine. Touching the former, the hypocrite, how eaſily is hee miſtaken by Selfe when he imagines himſelfe an holy perſon, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las all he hath is drawn from a land-ſpring of naturall parts and gifts, excellent affections, a conſcience onely enlightned to ſee and loath ſome ſinne, cuſtome, obſervation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the good, not to be good, but to be like the good only, good education, legall reſtraints, or good Lawes of men, and ſuperiours; here are deepe deluſions: And yet the wel-ſpring of Chriſt is wanting to make the ſtreames naturall, ſweet and running, equall &amp; uniforme, laſting and conſtant, ſincere and entire. And ſurely who ſo deceives
<pb facs="tcp:45715:7"/> himſelfe in his converſion, will eaſily deceive himſelf in his ſanctification: one Selfe will apply it ſelfe to all objects, be they never ſo diverſe. But Selfe-deniall will not ſatisfie her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in ſuch ſhreds: A body of death, the pollution and ſtaine of nature, are reall ſtrong principles: It muſt bee a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> which expels the firſt; pangs and devotions, imitations, affections, externall complements are not able to compaſſe ſo great a worke. So much for this; an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment well deſerving the beſt ſervice.</p>
            <p>To this fourth,<note place="margin">Annex to this fourth is, Selfe in converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> I annex the conſideration of Selfe in point of converſation and practice. And this is nothing elſe ſave the expreſſion of it ſelfe in the way of common life, a moſt endleſſe and infinite object to think of. Self in corrupt nature, Selfe in the remedy, Selfe in ſanctification, are three falſe principles, if ſhe paſſe through all theſe three unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and undenied, ſhee will as a ſtreame overflow all the life. Hence all thoſe uſuall paſſages of ſelf in the converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men: The hollow hearts of moſt men in friendſhip, eſpecially if tried: The ſelf-love of men in their contracts, bargaines, buyings, ſellings: The couſenages, circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tricks and devices, ſhifts and equivocations of men for their owne ends; their unfaithfulneſſe, breaking daies, promiſes, yea oaths and vowes; Selfe is at the end of all. Hence mens endleſſe adoring of the creature, money is the man, pleaſure is our life, preferment and honour is moſt mens Idol: Whoſe God is their belly, whoſe glory is their ſhame, who minde earthly things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18. and the like we ſee in mens converſation in other kindes; as if you croſſe them in this ſelfe of theirs, they are wilde: Give mee my wil or elſe I dye; take away my gourd, and I am fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke. So in their afflictions, whither runne men, ſave to their Idols of good workes, their charity and almes, what good have they done, how moraly they have lived, what credit they have had. If controverſies befall them, how ſtiffe in their owne cauſe, how inexorable in point of gain, how hard to forgive wrongs, and injuries, how aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in their owne ſenſe, and ſtiffe in their owne conceit. One River in tract of ground, hath divers names: ſo one
<pb facs="tcp:45715:8"/> ſelfe wee ſee in divers objects, puts on a diverſe exception: But contrary to all is ſelf-deniall. If any man will bee my Diſciple, let him deny himſelf; elſe ſelfe will keep him far enough from God and Chriſt, from faith, from ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from duty. And ſelfe-deniall in this kind is nothing elſe, ſave integrity and uprightneſſe of a mans way.<note place="margin">Prov. 10.27.</note> And ſo much be ſaid for thy better light in the diſtinct underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this Treatiſe. Other weighty arguments are alſo treated of herein, as the point of Faith, obedience of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, nature of the Promiſes; but becauſe they are more familiar objects, I leave thee to the peruſall thereof, as they ſhall offer themſelves to thy view.</p>
            <p>That which I will further adde ſhall bee to thee (good Reader) to whoſe hands it ſhall be the lot of this Booke to come: To wit, that both thou and I, and all Chriſtians into whoſe hands the great <hi>depoſitum</hi> of Truth is put, doe contend to our uttermoſt for the ſafegard and indemnity thereof, that as we have received it entire from our prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, ſo we may keepe and tranſmit it to them that ſhall follow us, without impair or blemiſh. Novelty, prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and lukewarmeneſſe are the three epidemiall evils, which as cankers, in ſeverall kindes and waies, fret to the heart of our Religion. So long as we can keep ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine on wing, we ſhall hope to kill or weaken all three. As <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abiathar,</hi> ſo may Truth ſay to Religion, Abide by me, he that ſeeketh thy life, ſeeketh mine, and with me thou ſhalt be in ſafety. Doubleſſe if a man had three can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in three ſeverall parts of his body threatning the heart, he would thinke it very much imported him to looke to himſelfe. the Holy Ghoſt himſelfe hath warned us of all three: of novelty, <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. Now the Spirit ſpeaketh evidently, that in the latter times men ſhall depart from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits, ſpeaking lies in hypocriſie, &amp;c. of prophaneneſſe the ſame Apoſtle warnes us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. In the latter times ſhall bee hard daies, &amp;c. mentioning eighteene of this rable, all rife and ranke among us. The three our Saviour Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe foretels to bee the diſeaſe of theſe times; and that
<pb facs="tcp:45715:8"/> as a fruit of the former. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.13. For there having ſpoken of novelty, and falſe Prophets, verſe 5. and verſe 11. he ſubjoines verſe 12. That iniquity ſhall abound; marke, error and prophaneneſſe concurre: And what of both theſe? Surely men beholding diverſity in opinions (through novelty) and prophaneneſſe of life, ſhall grow indifferent in point of their Religion, not greatly caring which end go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, yea many zelots ſhall quaile, for the love of many ſhall wax cold. We ſee all come to paſſe: Therefore let us all whom God cals by tongue or by penne, looke to the ſafeguard of Truth, and ſay as thoſe did to <hi>David,</hi> ſo we to Truth, Thou art worth ten thouſand of us, if we dye, wee may be ſupplied, but if thou ſhouldeſt miſcarry, all of us muſt periſh. As the life of old <hi>Iacob</hi> was bound up in <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamins;</hi> ſo ours in Truth.</p>
            <p>As in ſome former Treatiſes I have endeavoured to give <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Section </seg>5</label> my poore witneſſe to the practicall truths of Religion as a moſt ſworne enemy to all Schiſme and Novelty; ſo in this, I aime more eſpecially to encounter prophaneneſſe and lukewarmeneſſe, and both to convince the former, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the latter. As Sinne lies deeply rooted in the one; ſo even Grace it ſelfe, for lacke of quickning, lies dead in the other. Thoſe that are not ſunke into a prophane way, yet may be ſunke from a zealous. I conſider with my ſelfe, that as Treatiſes doe well for maintaining of truths: ſo Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are more peculiar for the ſuppreſſing of vicious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or lukewarm profeſſion. In Treatiſes we ſpeak Gods concluſions; in Sermons God ſeemes to ſpeake his owne; ſo great the oddes is, in what way a truth be uttered, our owne or Gods. As Iſrael thought herſelfe doubly ſtrong, having got the Arke into the Campe to fight with the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins: ſo in preaching, we ſeem to doe as the Angel, who went to heaven in the ſmoake of Gods ſacrifice. There is more of God in this method, then in any; and wee had need uſe the forcibleſt corraſives to eat out the dead fleſh of vice, and the keeneſt ſpurres to drive others out of the declining temper of their lukewarme profeſſion and neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality. <hi>Moſes,</hi> we know, might ſerve to teach people Truths
<pb facs="tcp:45715:9"/> and Ordinances: But when the great worke of ſcaring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and convincing the conſcience was to be done, God himſelfe was faine to deſcend in his likeneſſe with terror and ſmoke, and all too little: and queſtionleſſe, that is the moſt noble Ordinance which works moſt upon, and moſt prevailes with the part of man which is nobleſt, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we draw neareſt to God, the heart, I meane, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. In Gods ſacrifices, we read not much of the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon the braines, or offering them up to God by fire, but of the heart, liver, and the inward parts, the fat of them, as choice, was Gods part. The reaſon no doubt was, that, although the underſtanding is the guide of the ſoul, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the object of it is onely truth: But the object of the will and affections is properly good; and by embracing and affecting of good, we come nearer to God then by meere underſtanding of truth; therefore the word preached moſt affecting the inner man, by drawing, perſwading, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, quickning and comforting of it, muſt needs have the preeminence of all other Ordinances. There is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (in the unregenerate alway) a gulfe ſet betweene the underſtanding, and the affections, ſo that the one never comes at the other; but when once affections are truly ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, this gulfe vaniſheth, and an eaſie path-way is made in the ſoule to welcome Gods grace, and to expreſſe it in the life, neither ſeeme we in any other reſpect to excell thoſe wicked Angels, ſave in the goodneſſe of our affections. I ſpeake not this as an enemy to knowledge, without which the heart is nought, but becauſe the wofull age we live in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other things is moſt empty, and yet moſt careleſſe of getting good affections. Every one thinkes himſelfe to be happy in that he knoweth, not in that he affecteth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth or loveth, whereas in theſe latter, our union and communion with God conſiſts. The heart and ſpirit of the man, his bent, his frame, that is the man: and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that as they ſay of the materialls of the world, they would ſoone diſſolve if the ſoule of it were taken away; ſo the vaſt body of Light and Knowledge of many profeſſors will ruine and oppreſſe herſelfe ere long, for lack of ſutable
<pb facs="tcp:45715:9"/> life, ſpirit and affections. This notion ſeemed to me very forcible to perſwade the publiſhing of theſe Sermons after ſome other Treatiſes formerly ſet forth.</p>
            <p>But (will ſome ſay) we grant all: Sermons are indeed as you ſay, powerfull inſtruments to ſtirre the ſoule; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cill can fully reach a living face: The Preſſe cannot com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prehend the Pulpit, and writing of a Booke, is but as the picture of a dead man, in compariſon of the lively voice. To whom I anſwer, Time hath beene when I have beene ſo farre tranſported with this thought, that I would have preferred the preaching of a Sermon to the printing of a Booke. But now I muſt ſing another note, and therefore I anſwer further, although the objection in part be true, yet conſider God hath covered the uncomely parts with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt honour, and although the grace of the Spirit in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and giving overtures of lively impreſſion to the heart, cannot be equalled by printing, yet printing hath alſo that peculiar uſe which preaching it ſelfe reacheth not, that is, conſtantly to repreſent things, which while they were in uttering ſeemed pretious, but yet are ſoon forgotten:<note place="margin">Luke 1.4.</note> I ſay to preſent them alway to the eye, and ſo to hold them there, as a naile faſtned in a ſure place from wanzing and leaking out. And moreover, when the Preacher ſhall with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and obſervation, both marke wherein God aſſiſted him moſt, and hold himſelfe as neare as he can to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, ſomewhat more may be compaſſed in this kinde then otherwiſe. But however, he is a foole who counts not halfe a loafe better then no bread, or deſpiſeth the Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine becauſe the Sun is down: and I hope, that ſuch as were once attentive hearers of theſe things, when they read theſe Lectures, ſhall in ſome ſort recognize the ſavour and grace, which in hearing they ſeemed to acknowledge.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, to conclude, as I for my part thinke it a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that I may be the overſeer of mine owne Bookes, which elſe by audacious and unskilfull adventurers might have beene defaced, and alſo, that I may ſet my baſe heart on work any way to prevent ſloth &amp; eaſe.

Thirdly, in point of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward purchaſed by Chriſt; which (in reſpect of the tranſcendencie of the Meriter above the offence) reſtored not the redeemed onely to that they loſt, viz. an earthly Paradiſe, but an eternall glory in the heavens. I conclude then, Thoſe that make Chriſt the ſubject of univerſall grace for all and each one, who by the freedome of his will, aſſiſted thereby, will receive it, or reject it (catch who catch may) I ſay, theſe make Chriſt onely a wandring notion, at the pleaſure of each baſe wretch, not the ſolid foundation of election, as making the elect, and only them, happy.</p>

Hereby hee aggravates the contempt of all deſpiſers, cauſing their condemnation to be farre deeper then before; eſpecially knowing that it will prove ſo.</p>
            <p>I anſwer: Firſt, it is accidentall to Gods offer of Grace, that the condemnation of the wicked is aggravated thereby. For it is not through his default, but theirs. His offer is directly to his own elect; but if the other will mixe themſelves, and abuſe this offer, their blood bee upon their heads. But caſe a Prince offer his pardon to ten, of whom hee knowes nine will not accept it: is it his fault to offer it? or is he the cauſe of their contempt? Doth he infuſe it into them? No ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Nay further, (to ſtop the mouth of all ſuch cavillers) this I adde, That God doth not hereby onely aggravate their judgement: for he doth by his Goſpel beſtow upon them many gifts of his Spirit, much reſtraint of ſinne, many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull allowances which others want, ſo that by this meanes their condemnation is leſſened.</p>

                  </gap>bject.</note>But ſtill it is objected, How can this Doctrine conſiſt with that bounty and abundance of mercy in God, who would have all repent and be ſaved? Offering fully, freely, to all ſorts, civil ones, profane, ſinfull and ignorant ones, mercy without difference? Doth not this abſolute ſoveraignty of God infringe it?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, No, in no wiſe: The ſecret purpoſe of God within himſelfe, and the outward offer, differ as much, as the preſence Chamber of a Prince, and his privie Chamber. In the former, he ſheweth what hee hath done concerning the finall eſtate of his creature: In the latter, what he will have man doe, concerning his own ſalvation. Secrets are for God, revealed things are for us. God launches out into the deepe; but we muſt goe by the brinke and ſhore. The ſoveraigne freedome of God is not taught to diſhearten any in Gods way (for who knowes Gods laſt decree touching himſelfe) but to teach us to goe to worke with awe in Gods way, to feare him, to be humbled, ſubmitting our ſelves to his revealed will, with readineſſe, and without cavilling. For otherwiſe this ſoveraignty and freedome in God, hinders not his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace to allure, draw, perſwade, and ſoften the hearts of whom he will. But this will try men whether they will yeeld to the way of God, or kick againſt it, and ſo provoke wrath.</p>

            <p>I anſwer: The Miniſter is Gods inſtrument, to reveale Gods will to the people, but not his ſecrets. Hee muſt nakedly doe his office, and leave the effect to God, who workes grace in ſuch as ſubmit to him. He knowes not what God hath intended to any one wicked man. If any will cavill at him, his damnation is juſt, to reject Gods cords and ladder. As for Gods complaining, threatning, denouncing, it is no act contrary to his ſecret will, but onely divers from it. And it is a way which he bleſſeth to draw home thouſands to himſelfe.</p>

And, for the new Teſtament, what is it, ſave a continued tenor of divine and miraculous operations of the Lord Jeſus and his Apoſtles? So that we may perceive the holy Ghoſt to reigne in this kinde, and to take a kinde of felicity, to get out from naked and common diſcourſe, to ſome rare and wonderfull expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the workes of God, his Revelations, viſions, and ſtrange acts in and for his Church.<note place="margin">The cauſe why?</note> And ſurely, if we ſhall enquire into the reaſon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; we ſhall finde, that the Lord hath in wiſdome choſen this courſe, as well knowing the mould and frame of them he had then,<note place="margin">1 Our lumpiſh earthy mould.</note> and hath now to deale withall: I meane both thoſe Jewes, and us Gentiles, all the fonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> and the fleſh. That is with cloddy, carnall, dead and ſenſuall creatures, ſtiffnecked and rebellious ones; wits and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſavouring nothing but the creature, or at leaſt promiſes of meer tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall kinde, but as for matters of divinity and ſpirituall nature, utterly ſavourleſſe. Contraries are cured by contraries: and if there be any thing able to raiſe and elevate muddy and loggiſh ſpirits from the dunghill, and from creeping heer below: it muſt be a divine ſtreame of ſtrange and unheard of accidents, adminiſtrations, and atcheivements, whereby the baſe heart of man (as the Angel in the ſmoke of the ſacrifice) may
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45715:22"/> riſe up to heavenly and holy thoughts and affections. Hereby the dull and blunt ſences the dead hearts of ſinfull men are whetted up, (farre more then by raviſhing muſique) to Gods matters, and are taken off from the earth.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Lord hath bin faine to take the advantage of our baſe frame,<note place="margin">2 By ſenſible things God takes us at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</note> (which is much amuſed and aſtoniſht at the ſight and hearſay of uncouth and ſtrange matters:) to drive in thereby holy things, which elſe would be but flat notions, vaniſhing and comming to nothing: the tree which hath long lien ſodding in the ditch, if it be once unſettled, may be carried home. Much harder is it to ſtir the ſence and quicken the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, lying dead and in cool bloud, then to work a further and ſuperior im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in it, being once raiſed. The ſpirit of a man, though it be corrupt and dead, yet being immortall, cannot ſo far forget it ſelfe (if once God quicken it) as to lay aſide her nature altogether. Therefore the Lord mainly aimes at ſtirring of it up from her dead frame. No other reaſon can be given why <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> came with ſuch a hideous outſide of apparrel, camels haire, courſe diet,<note place="margin">Luke 3.</note> and alſo with the extraordinary ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Elia:</hi> ſave that the people being taken at firſt by his guiſe and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, might be wrought upon the more eaſily by his Miniſtry, preparing and levelling their rough and high ſpirits for their Lord Jeſus. And what other uſe had all thoſe miracles wherewith the doctrine of Chriſt, and all the preaching of the Apoſtles were accompanied: ſave this, that by and with them as by Tunnels, the influence, power and authority of truth might enter and prevaile with the mindes and conſciences of the hearers ere they were aware? That, they being amazed and convinced by the greatneſſe of thoſe ſignes and effects which attended and followed the word, might have no power nor ſpirit left in them to contradict him that ſpake thereby: but yeeld and beleeve the truth for the workes ſake. The miracles themſelves, the healing of a leper, the reſtoring of the lame, the raiſing up of the dead, the healing of the ſicke; the doing of the workes, and benefiting of the perſons, was not the iſſue and intent of the worker: but that the glory of that God, the grace of that ſpirit which wrought ſuch wonders might ſoke and ſinke into the ſoules of men, before and upon, whoſe eies and perſons thoſe miracles were diſcovered: That by this meane, converſion from Idols, and ſinfull courſes, unto the living God might be effected, through faith in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Witneſſe that ſtory of the woman of Samaria in the fourth of S. <hi>Iohn:</hi> To whom the Lord Jeſus did ſo expreſſe himſelfe, as to declare all the ſecrets of her heart, to convince her of all the villanies that ever ſhe had committed in all her ſeven husbands time: and why? Surely that ſhe having her loade of heart within her, might go into the City, &amp; tell it her kindred and acquaintance, draw them to Chriſt himſelfe, as being aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht at his excellency; and being once within his compaſſe, might be eaſily pulled by his doctrine, to a further pitch of grace, and ſay, Now we beleeve not becauſe of the wordes which thou haſt ſpoken: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have heard him ſpeake himſelfe.</p>

Many chuſe patheticall texts, hiſtories and accidents, actions and ſpeeches of ſpeciall note, to read and pleaſe themſelves in; ſome delight to read of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Temple, others of the paſſion of Chriſt, others other parcells of Scripture to provoke admiration and diſcourſe, even as they might read any other booke of tales and wonders: ſome alſo read texts of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and holineſſe, as the Pſalmes, or wiſe ſentences, as the Proverbs with a morrall ſpirit and ſcope only, but never muſe of the ſeverall ends of ſuch places nor the ſpirit of grace therein, ſave onely to amuſe their mindes, and ſtirre up pangs of affection: But by theſe, to come neerer to know their owne baſe hearts, or to cloſe with the examples of ſuch grace, to feare the judgements of God the more deepely, to beleeve the promiſes better, to ſubject themſelves more to the commands of God

Therefore let us read theſe texts with prayer to God for ſence and ſavor of their meaning and ſcope: that we may attaine the ſpiritualneſſe of them: Elſe we ſhall anſwer heavily to God for making the ſolemne and reverend truths of God, an occaſion to nouriſh and maintaine that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt diſpoſition, novelty, carnall admiration, jangling and unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which the Scripture eſpecially ſerves to mortifie in us.</p>
               <p>To give a taſte of my meaning in an inſtance:<note place="margin">An inſtance of the exhort.</note> let that be the miracle recorded 2 King. 7. to wit, the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> his cauſing of the Iron to ſwimme, when it was fallen into the water; he that reads it as a bare mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle will onely vaniſh in a wondering humor: but he that reads it with faith, and reverence, will behold the power of God, over-ruling the creatures quality, and cauſing the waighty body of iron to float like a chip, contrary to the nature of it. And what will ſuch a meditation picke out of it? Surely a ſweet conſolation in the power of God; <hi>viz.</hi> to over-rule a worſe nature in a worſe ſubject: even the dulneſſe and lumpiſhneſſe of an heavy heart in matters of God, and cauſe it to mount up from this baſe dunghill, whereunto tis fixed, unto heaven and holy thoughts: yea, to change this hard heart, more hard then a flint, or iron, and make it a ſoft and fleſhy heart, to write his covenant in it, and cauſe it to walke in his Commandements; where from tis as farre as iron from ſwimming. If then the caſting in of a ſticke could worke ſuch an effect: if the bare power of God (onely for a witneſſe that the worke then intended was from God) without any reſpect to the iron it ſelfe, could doe this great thing: what ſhall be the power of God working in and by the bloodſhed and interceſſion of the Lord Jeſus upon an heart of heavier frame and harder, which thereby ſhall be much the better in it ſelfe, beſides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite honour which the worker of this miraculous change ſhall purchaſe to himſelfe by it? although to carnall reaſon it may ſeeme impoſſible?</p>

Surely if ſtrange things will affect us, as who now adaies affect not (Athenian wiſe) new and ſtrange reports and accidents, to heare and to tell them (though emptily and as paſſages for preſent talke) this text hath cauſe, and may plead to be ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally marked above many.

The diſeaſe ſtrange, an incurable leproſie; the cure ſtrange, by the applying of common water to his fleſh (to reaſon incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible.) The courſe by <hi>Naaman</hi> ſtrange in miſtaking an Idolatrous King for his Phyſitian, in ſteed of an holy Prophet: the redreſſe of the error ſtrange, by an intimation from God, to fetch him the right way to the Prophet: his carriage ſtrange, in humble ſliding before a poore Prophets doore, and (to come neerer the text) the meſſage uncouth and ſtrange,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45715:25"/> for a Prophet not to vouchſafe to come to the doore to a petitioning Prince, but to ſend an aloofe meſſage: <hi>Naamans</hi> enterteining it ſtrange, and promiſing but a ſiniſter ſucceſſe, (for what likelyhood is it that a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient raging at his Phyſitian ſhould be cured?) The perſwaſion ſtrange even by ſervants, (not likely either to perſwade aright, or to prevaile by perſwading) But above all the effect of this counſell, ſtrange, that he ſhould obey his ſervants, who cavelled againſt the Prophet: the ſucceſſe of his obeying ſtrange, to recover his fleſh as the fleſh of a child: And to conclude, the conſequents of the ſucceſſe ſtrange, both his ſpirituall cure of Soule-leproſie, the extraordinary zeale and reſolution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Idols for the true God: and the moſt ſincere deteſtation of that moſt predominant and beloved luſt, which before had prevailed, to wit, to worſhip Rimmon himſelf, &amp; be his Maſters leaning ſtock in that worſhip. So many ſtrange concurrences, might (I ſay) juſtly force our attention to this ſtory: and yet the chiefe thing contained in it, is no ſtranger thing, then that which we daily carry about us, I mean ſelf and carnall reaſon: But ſo intricated and wrapped about us, ſo deeply ſeated and hidden in our ſpirits, that (without the great goodneſſe of God) we ſhall behold it, read it over and over, wonder at it in <hi>Naaman,</hi> but ſee none of it in our ſelves, and ſo leave the peruſall of this Treatiſe with as ſmall fruit as we began it.

The words uſed by our Saviour, do occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to touch upon this point, &amp; its of no ſmall importance. To wit, that the Lord paſſing by all other lepers in Iſrael, neerer hand, and liker to make uſe of the Prophets helpe, then one a far off, (who onely by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a ſilly wench at ſecond hand, had intelligence of him) ſhould out of his meer grace ſend him to this <hi>Naaman</hi> and <hi>Naaman</hi> to him, (which phraſe imports a ſending of ſpirituall efficacy to converſion) and, make him a marke of greater mercy then his owne people, yea an upbraiding to them, in all ſucceeding generations. Many lepers (ſaith Chriſt) there were in the daies of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> but to none of them all, was he ſent, ſave only to <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian. Whether no other lepers at all were healed by <hi>Eliſha,</hi> its heard to ſay: and me thinkes as hard to imagine, that all lepers ſhould ſo ſcape his hands. Perhaps they did not: and partly the Damoſells report evinces it, for how elſe ſhould ſhe ſo readily point at <hi>Eliſha</hi> for the cure of <hi>Naamans</hi> diſeaſe, if ſhe had never heard of his healing others in that kinde? Howbeit I affirme nothing: ſhe might ſpeake from a generall honour ſhe bare to the Prophets worth: but this is ſure: although ſome lepers might come to <hi>Eliſha;</hi> yet he was ſent to none ſave to <hi>Naaman:</hi> that is, the Lord uſed him not to the ſpirituall good and ſalvation of any other ſave him. I hope, I ſhall not need to prove the truth of his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: If any doubt of it, let them note, but the ſcope of our Saviours
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45715:25"/> diſcourſe in that place of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> and it will ſatisfie him: for, except it be granted that <hi>Naaman</hi> was converted, the whole ſcope of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours ſpeech is overthrowne.

                  </gap>y is this,<note place="margin">Luke 4.27.</note> to convince and upbraid his owne countrymen for their contempt and infidelity: and that by <hi>Naamans</hi> example. As if he ſhould ſay, Truſt not to this that you and I are Townſmen, and neer of acquaintance; God is no excepter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, grace is free, and mercy is neither of the willer or runner, but of him who ſheweth mercy: look well to your ſelves, that ye deſpiſe not the offer I make, as little worth, and thinking your ſelves <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the promiſe: for, (except ye beleeve) the Lord can paſſe by thoſe of the kingdome, and call in from the Eaſt and Weſt, ſtrangers, even ſuch as <hi>Naaman,</hi> and thruſt out the children. Marke then, except <hi>Naaman</hi> were converted, the Jewes might have had a ready evaſion to eſcape the dint of this exprobration, and have ſaid, Why Lord? <hi>Eliſha</hi> was no more ſent to <hi>Naaman,</hi> then thou art ſent to us, there was no more wrought in him, then in us. This had bin to cut the ſinewes of Chriſts argument aſunder. And whereas it may be alledged, Chriſt did no miracles at Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth: I anſwer, it is uncertaine: But ſay he did not, it had bin ſmall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding of them, with the want of miracles, if he had not much more caſt them in teeth, with the want of that, for which miracles ſerved, I meane grace and faith. This objection then thus removed; I returne and ſay, that the Lord ſent <hi>Eliſha</hi> to <hi>Naaman</hi> for the cure of ſoule and body, out of an eſpeciall freedome of Graces, which he denied to others, who were far fairer for it then he: That the glory of this free and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne mercy and compaſſion might only be aſcribed to God.</p>

Now it is evident that this is free, for it requires not, nor cannot require any antecedent diſpoſition or fitneſſe in the called: All are equally ſunke into rebellion in reſpect of their nature: and as concerning the practice, ſure it is that howſoever the morals of ſome may poſſibly be worſe then others: yet this can be no bar unto Gods free viſiting them with light; if he pleaſe ſo to do: and there is no wickedneſſe of man, over which the grace of the Goſpel may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile.<note place="margin">Deut. 9.4.</note> Say not (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) that the Lord hath choſen thee from among all other Nations, becauſe thou wert better then they: for thou wert the worſt of all Nations: But it was free mercy which thus choſe and called thee to the Covenant, and to be a people: That cauſed the Lord to call thee from all other Nations of the world though all the world were his: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it is not the moralnes of any people, nor their vertuous qualities, which can move the Lord to ſhew them the light of further grace: but if he leave them in their moralities, it is juſt and righteous. Sure it is, this unconditionall call is as free as the raine which falls upon the earth, in ſome places plentifully, in ſome ſcantly, in ſome not at all. Even where the Lord in ſoveraigne wiſdome ſhall pleaſe to ſend it. Some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Lord permitted his Apoſtles to goe to: others the Spirit forbad them to viſit. God had no people there, therefore the meanes were held from them. Not, becauſe the meanes were not granted: he had no people; but becauſe he had no people, therefore meanes were not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Now concerning this former call, how many Nations of the world are excluded? Untill Chriſt all the world was excommunicate: (for the times of that ignorance God regarded not) and ſince Chriſt, (now full one thouſand ſix hundred years and odde) how many are uncalled? if ſome ſpeake truly, ſcarce a ſixth or ſeventh part is yet viſited: if it were but the one halfe, it were enough to prove this freedome. Cavills there are ſome againſt this former freedome, (the moſt of which are taken from the reſpects of more ſinfullneſſe in thoſe people or their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, or ſome former contempt:) but they are ſo idle and ſenſleſſe, that the diviſers of them, ſhew rather their deſire to oppoſe, then any ſound reaſon.</p>

And that concernes ſuch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned; and that is alſo ſoveraignly free, and meerely gracious. For why? this condition is Faith: which is a ſecond free gift to the elect, following the former freedome of viſiting with light. Now this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not all mens lot, All men have not faith. 2 Theſſ. 3.2. nay it is a flower growing in few gardens.

                  </label> and none can ſay, What doſt thou? And againe, whomſoever God ſaves, they confeſſe, that he ſaves them of his free and meere grace: But yet they adde, This grace is an univerſall one, anſwering to the univerſality of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: and therefore by vertue hereof, all may (if they will, and doe not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45715:27"/> put a barre to themſelves) receive this grace, but if they doe not, the cauſe (ſay they) is not from any defect in the ſufficiency of grace, or from any ſoveraignty in Gods diſpenſing it to ſome, more then others: for (ſay they) as he ought it to none at all; ſo, when he offers it freely, he offers it to ſome one with the ſame freedome and efficacy, with which he offers it to any one: and the difference of the accepting by one, and the not accepting by another, flowes from the different diſpoſitions, and free-will of him that nilleth or willeth: but not (ſay they) from any diverſity of diſpoſition in God. Beſides, the reaſon why they affirme grace muſt be univerſall, is this, becauſe elſe (ſay they) God ſhould deale hardly with the creature, to urge it to ſuch a condition of grace as he doth not allow him ſufficient ſtrength to performe, and yet puniſh him for the not performing thereof more deeply, then if ſuch grace had never bin offred: yea, to urge it to performe ſuch a condition as he never was able in his beſt integrity to performe. I anſwer. God doth not exact any ſuch condition at mans hand, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> as he gave him not ſufficient ſtrength to performe. For, man had at the firſt, ſtrength enough to performe, not onely whatſoever God did then require: But alſo whatſoever he might require, which included a power to obey univerſally. And therefore man having loſt that power by his fall, ſtands juſtly guilty before God of his impotency to beleeve the promiſe. But they ſtill urge, <hi>Adam</hi> could not poſſibly have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to beleeve,<note place="margin">Inſtan.</note> in his innocency, ſince that preſuppoſes a thing which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>

That looked at the alſufficient goodneſſe of Creation; this of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet both behold God as the ſame object ſtill of infinite good, (in ſeverall regards) and fidelity to his creature.</p>
               <p>Secondly I anſwer: That is falſe, and inconſequent, to affirme, that <label type="milestone">

But that, they are not: For, in the creation, the Lord could not but impart himſelfe to the creature, according to that bounty and goodneſſe of his excellent nature without any difference. But in the grace of redemption, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> Chriſt was no ſuch large ſubject of imputation of all grace, as <hi>Adam</hi> was of ſin.

And ſo Chriſt ſhould have added to the number of the elect, and bin a Lord not a ſervant to election, (as a mediator:) nor a foundation of executing it, but a cauſe of morall ſwaſion to apprehend the truth, and embrace the good which is offered them, I demand, why doe not all pertake it, one as well as another? For if there be ſuch free will in them to receive it, what lets them from it? who would willingly balke heaven who might goe thither, or who would not ſhun hell, if his ſhunning deſire would ſerve the turne?<note place="margin">Deut. 4.</note> Is there not a naturall ſelfelove in all to wiſh well unto themſelves, and to avoide the contrary, if that were ſufficient? If any ſhall ſay, the ſtrong luſts of ſome dazle their light, and oppreſſe the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their will from accepting the offer, then I anſwer, how can that be called ſufficient grace which is faine to give place unto prevailing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption? That is onely ſufficient which is effectuall to overcome and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſway the will, not which is compelled to yeeld and give place to the prevailing corruption of the will which it meets withall. What a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is that, to grace not to be able to effect her owne ends, but to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by corruption? Grace doubtles, (if it be ſufficiently offered to all, that are enlightned) would ſufficiently caſt downe and ſubdue the ſtrongeſt holds, and higheſt thoughts of reſiſtance, ſet up in the ſoule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; and ſo would ſave all without contradiction, as being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible principle, as much above the power of ſinne, as God is above the creature. Either therefore this univerſall grace doth convert all who receive it (which none is ſo abſurd as to affirme, being contrary to ſenſe and common experience) or elſe it muſt needs be denied to be ſufficient and powerfull to doe that which it intendeth. And therefore of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there muſt needs be another grace confeſſed, as neceſſary for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of that which this univerſall grace cannot attaine unto, and that is that ſoveraigne and free grace of the ſpirit, which peculiarly workes in the elect; not an aid and concurring ſuccour to their free will, but that grace of willing freely, which they want wholly, and that ſtrength to ſubdue rebellion and unbeleefe which no enlightning grace (alone) can reach: I ſay it muſt be a peculiar grace of converſion, which worketh
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45715:28"/> both the will and the deed, and is ſo effectuall, that no ſtrength either of ſinne or the gates of hell can prevaile againſt it. Thus much I thought not unfit to ſay, for the explication of the point: enough a popular audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for the ground of a ſermon: leaving deeper diſcourſe to Treaties for the nonce.</p>

Had they clave to their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note place="margin">4 Or penalties of wicked.</note> but in the matter of it, they had bin highly rewarded: and therefore falling off in coole bloud from doing the outward act, which was in their power, in the midſt of ſo many encouragements, how juſt was their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw? Why did the Lord inflict ſo heavy a plague upon all the poſterity for <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne? Becauſe it was a bundell of all ſinne, in one: and if he had ſtood, he had enjoyed all happineſſe for himſelfe and his? If the Lord Jeſus did juſtly accurſe the ſervant, I mean the figtree, for not bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring figs at all ſeaſons, (which, if ſin had not letted, it might have done) ſhall not the maſter much more be accurſed, for making himſelfe barren being created fruitfull?</p>

                  <note place="margin">5 Nor for lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note>So alſo, let us not accuſe God for ſuffering them to fall. Its ſaid <hi>Hoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> and <hi>Phinees</hi> could not hearken to their father, becauſe God would ſlay them. And the Jewes could not heare the voice of the Lord, becauſe <hi>Eſay</hi> had foretold the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that God had hardned them. For why?<note place="margin">Act. ult.</note> God put no evill into any of them: But becauſe he ſaw what baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and rebellion was in them already, he left them thereto, and would not overpower their hearts: for it was juſt for him thereby to be avenged upon them, for their wilfull contempt: and ſo make them as ſnares to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to fall by. Thoſe ten tribes were juſtly ſnared by <hi>Ieroboams</hi> calves, becauſe they had plaid the Idolaters before in <hi>Salomons</hi> daies, under the freedome of the Temple worſhip: and ſo God would plague them for all at once, and both give them a King in wrath, and ſweep them away in diſpleaſure. A maſter having a ſlie ſervant, oft drunken and careleſſe of his buſineſſe, to the end he may pay him for all, doth juſtly ſend him to ſome place which accidentally occaſions him to fall: he ſends him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an errand juſtly, but becauſe he means to prevent all his ſhifts, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him ſoundly, he will ſuffer him to fall into a ſnare, that he may take him in the manner, and puniſh him for all his prankes together. So, when God puniſhes the ſinnes of parents upon the children, <hi>Ahabs</hi> upon <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, Eli's</hi> upon thoſe hundred and eighty Prieſts ſlaine by <hi>Saul, Salomons</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:45715:29"/> upon <hi>Rehoboam.</hi> For why? The Lord beholding them, in the ſinnes of their parents imitated and unrepented of, deſtroies both ſerpent and egs together. Let us I ſay ſtrive to be convinced in our judgements,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.

Or, becauſe we are not able to do that which he requires for the matter, ſhall we therefore, in a ſullen and deſperate humour, ſit ſtill and doe nothing? Shall we not ſhun any ſinne for conſcience, which we can ſhun, if hired with mony? Becauſe all is not, either in our willing or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſhall we neither will or run?

Shall we therefore doe nothing which lies in our power to do? yes ſurely in holy awe of this freedome of God to do with us, and our endeavours, what him liſts, let us tremble, and in all humility doe the beſt we can: yet truſting to none of it, loathing to be Phariſees and Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, but abhorring much more to be Epicures and malecontents: walke we in Gods way, in which he only is found, and may be found of us: But thoſe that diſdain to heare, to pray, to take paines becauſe God hath the bridle in his owne hand, ſhew themſelves Giants rather, and ſuch as would be revenged upon God, then deſirous to get heaven, by ſubmitting to his power and Soveraignty. As thoſe lamps were fitly planted under the olive branches to receive the oile which dropped from them by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, ſo let us accommodate our ſelves under the dropping of the ordinances, aſcribing nothing to our ſelves, but all to the meer grace of the ordainer, as <hi>Zachary</hi> there ſpeakes,<note place="margin">Zacha. 4 5.</note> not by ſtrength or mans wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but by my ſpirit ſaith the Lord.</p>

               <p>Seventhly, yet reſt not in this dejection onely. Conſider that the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch </seg>7</label> of God doth not reach only to deſtroy the creature,<note place="margin">Soveraignty is free to ſave, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy.</note> but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to abaſe it, and ſave it.

And therefore apply thy ſelfe to the beholding of thoſe cords which the Goſpell puts in, and offers thee in this dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, and of that ladder which is thruſt in for thee to come up by, as to the meer implodding and ſadding thy thoughts with the likelyhood of thy confuſion.

Not by thy ſtruggling and fighting againſt it (as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> againſt the waters returning) but by thy meeke and humble ſtooping under it. And know, that this doctrine of Gods ſoveraignty ſerves to try the ſpirit of men, of what mettle they are made of, and to condemne none, ſave the finally rebellious. Thoſe who ceaſe whetting at Gods ſecrets (as not belonging to them) and only betake themſelves to the ſoftly ſtreames of Siloam: beholding with ſtedfaſt eye,<note place="margin">Deut. 29.29.</note> the freedome, bottomedneſſe, and unchangeableneſſe of the promiſe, have a marke upon them of ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, the ſoveraignty of Gods ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt the poore creature notwithſtanding.

               <p>Eightly, let this conviction of judgement turne thy ſoule to make an adventure, and where thou ſeeſt a breach made, there to lay the battery <label type="milestone">

Doſt thou behold the Lord Jeſus lying at the ſtake with thy guilt, as thy ſurety, for whoſe ſake the deadly enmity of God is abated toward thee? And doth this cauſe thee to take more thought for thy ſoule, then to diſpute with God? Well then, feed thine heart with this thought; that the Lord will ſave ſome, and whom, ſave thoſe whom its provided for; even thoſe who can beleeve that free mercy is as well worth the embracing, as ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty is worth the fearing? and therefore determine with themſelves, rather with a trembling foot to goe towards the former, then with a blaſphemous mouth to goe to hel? Leave Gods ſecrets, and try him in his revealed will, and way, he hath profeſſed that none who chuſe life ſhall dye: none ſhall endure the diſadvantage of their ſin, who come to Chriſt, as having diſcharged them from it, by bearing it for them. Chuſe then to live.<note place="margin">1 King. 20.33.</note>

And by thy diſtruſt, and ſealing up thy heart under the darkeneſſe, bondage and feare of thy former guilt, (whatſoever Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and unbeleefe tell thee) ſure it is thou goeſt the next way to croſſe God of his purpoſed intention to glorifie himſelf marveilouſly in thy pardon and ſalvation.<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 1.8.</note> And therefore inſtead of his being admired in thee becauſe thou beleeveſt: he juſtly will be admired in thy double venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, becauſe it was not enough for thee once to ſinne in <hi>Adam,</hi> but thou addeſt drunkenneſſe to thirſt, in denying that grace which would have taken occaſion by thy ſinne, to ſettle an infinite glory upon himſelf, and far better eſtate upon thee, then <hi>Adams</hi> innocency could have done. And ſo much for this ſecond uſe of exhortation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this point ſhould be humiliation to all ſorts, becauſe the <label type="milestone">

How ſhould it pull downe our carnall preſumption and jollity to conſider, that even while we are hearing the word, the Lord might ſtop our breath, (as the breath of one almoſt, was while this point
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45715:32"/> was in handling, being a ſleepe at the ſermon) which of us ſtand not at Gods curteſie for ſomewhat which others are deprived of.

Oh! with how narrow an eye and foot, and how ſoberly would we uſe each bleſſing if we were bound in a ſtatute to a creditor, to ſurrender all at an houres warning, and ſtood at his curteſie for the bread we eat? Would we then take our fill, or the uttermoſt liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our commodities? Even ſo let us walke humbly before God who is our Soveraigne, and hath our lives, wealth, and perſons at command, in a moment to ſurprize us. Let us daily take all as lent us from his hand, let us uſe all humbly and purely as if we uſed them not, let us count out ſelves daily to be in jeopardy, and bid adiew daily to all comforts here below, yea life it ſelfe. As an holy man being asked over night, whether he would goe to ſuch a place to morrow, or no; anſwered, I thanke God,<note place="margin">Note.</note> I have known no morrow theſe twenty yeares.

And ſure it is the little acknowledging of this

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">God gives not account of all his matters.</note>And to conclude, the Lord is a ſoveraigne God alſo in reſpect of his adminiſtration of his whole militant Church. Although ſhe be his ſpouſe, and hath a right to all his goodneſſe: yet God gives not an account of all his matters, nay oftentimes, ſhe incurres a premunire with God, and by her former, lazy, Laodicean temper of a fulſome, careleſſe, ſurfeted ſpirit, deſerves that the Lord ſhould uſe his ſoveraignty and prerogative of diſcipline over her, for her correction and amendment. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he take not his loving kindneſſe from her yet,<note place="margin">Sins of the Church, the cauſe of Gods hiding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note> her Lethargy and Palſey frame, her wearineſſe and contempt of his ordinances and their power, may cauſe him to chaſten her with the rods of men. Now we are (in ſuch caſes of wanting the meanes, of injury and violence of times, encroaching of enemies, inundation of errors and profaneneſſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of love and zeale in the better ſort) very prone to taxe Gods wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and call him to our barre, as if we would teach him more wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.<note place="margin">See Jer. 12.1.2.</note> But alas! the Lord is a ſoveraigne God, and knowes what phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke our maladies require, he knowes our ruſt will not be filed off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much rubbing and ſcowring: He lookes at the generall ends of his providence, which are to puniſh ſeverely, the declenſions and revolts of ſuch as profeſſe his Name: let us not wonder that our praiers ſticke in their aſcent, and prevaile little: we looke ſtill at meanes and ordinances, to be ſtill as we have beene, but the Lord lookes at the melting and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging out our droſſe, and trying us whether we be reprobate ſilver or no. In this caſe, what ſhall we doe? call for our prayers backe againe, and

No ſurely: let us know we can goe no whither to ſpeed better, if we leave him: but confeſſe his ſoveraigne power might force him to a decree againſt us: &amp; lie low, licking the duſt of his feet,<note place="margin">John 6.68. 2 King. 23.2.3. &amp;c.

               <p>Thirdly, this doctrine is confutation and reproofe of the enemies of <label type="milestone">

Oh! it frets them to the very heart to heare, that there ſhould be any ſuch liberty aſcribed to God! They confeſſe that on mans part there may be ſome barres to hinder grace: But they cannot endure it, that when the object lyes indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently diſpoſed, then ſoveraignty ſhould reject, or receive upon meere will, no reaſon at all appearing: this cuts them to the heart, that they may not bind the hands of God behind him, to carry himſelfe alike to all, who lye in equall and faire correſpondence to it: But O ye wretches! goe learne what this meanes, not of the willer, or the runner, but of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.

No, no, not the appearances of man can bind the Lord, but his free love muſt overrule him. The moſt poore, deſpiſed, impotent, and ſilly wench among all thy brood may ſpeed of mercy, when the braveſt, wittieſt, and hopefulleſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goes without.

But know, that as the end, ſo the meanes, and the ordering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is in his hands. Wouldſt thou deny thy ſelfe all ſuccors of the creature to feed and cheriſh thee, becauſe if the Lord have appointed thee to live, <label type="milestone">

For, the ſtupid King of Iſrael, (having ſmall entercourſe, and leſſe intereſt in the Prophet of God) miſtakes the letter, and the ſcope of it, and conſtrues it to a ſiniſter ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that a quarrel was pickt with him, he rends his cloathes, and askes am I God to heale lepers? which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, he had not ſaid, if his thoughts had bin upon the Prophets miraculous aſſiſtance two chapters before,<note place="margin">2 King. 3.5.6.</note> when he was in a diſtreſſe, for lack of water. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>5</label> Here therefore the worke ſtands at a ſtay. Fifthly, therefore the Lord (whoſe worke it was to bring <hi>Naaman</hi> thus farre within the Element of mercy and cure) doth not faile, but puts in life to the buſineſſe: and checks the ſenceleſſe King by a meſſenger ſent from <hi>Eliſha;</hi> who upbraiding him for his ſottiſh ignorance, prompts him with that truth which corrects <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amans</hi> miſtake, ſaying: although thou canſt not heale him thy ſelfe, yet be it knowne to thee, Iſrael hath a God who hath a Prophet, even <hi>Eliſha</hi> by name, to whom if thou ſend this man, he will heale him of his lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Upon this meſſage the text tells us, that <hi>Naaman</hi> forſaking the King (who could doe him no good) comes now (full of courage and good hopes) that although he had miſcarried hitherto, yet now, at laſt, he ſhould without any more adoe, ſpeed of his journey. And therefore he with his horſes and charets come downe and ſtand before the doore
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45715:35" rendition="simple:additions"/> of <hi>Eliſha.</hi> Thus we ſee the coherence, and have the patient ſtanding humbly at the doore of the Prophet, forgetting his ſtate, and being at the curteſie of the Prophet for his cure. Now for the laſt of theſe.</p>
               <p>Two things I would commend unto you out of this verſe.<note place="margin">Two generals in this ninth verſe.</note> The former is, the habit and behaviour of this great Prince, and favorite <hi>Naaman,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now at the doore of the Prophet.

Generall. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>amans humble carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> But all humble, and lowly carriage, ſuch as became a petitioning Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, who though he brought fees enough with him, yet could ſpeed no way, ſave by waiting and obeying. This behaviour may ſeeme ſtrange in ſo potent a Prince at ſo meane an houſe as the Prophets, and toward a man in ſhew ſo farre inferior, as a poore old man to a Kings favorite. Surely theſe daies would ſcarce affords us ſuch a patterne of humbleneſſe, in great ones toward Gods Miniſters. But the reaſon was, <hi>Naaman</hi> had, and felt that burden and clog within, which beat off proud thoughts: not only the honour of the Prophet, and divineneſſe of the cure awed him: but the yoak which was upon him, ſubdued all hautineſſe, ſuppreſſed all ſtomacke, and pride, telling him, as the caſe ſtood, it was no ſeaſon for him to take upon him imperiouſly; He was now fighting a new battel, wherein not his armes, but his patience muſt beare maſtries. Doubtleſſe, his great ſpirits might riſe, and provoke him to inſolency; but ſtill he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his errand, aand for the time, thought it fitteſt to ſtoope leſt he ſhould looſe the maine, his cure hoped for, this amed him and kept him low: ſtanding with all his pompous retinue at the poore gate of poore <hi>Eliſha,</hi> waiting, and glad to waite for a favourable anſwer.</p>
               <p>The point I would urge, is this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Great ſtraights are Gods ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to pull downe a ſtout heart.</note> the only ſeaſon of working a jolly and ſtout heart to crouch and creepe, is, when God hath it at a bay, even to ſtand at his curteſie in ſome great ſtraight and extermity. It was thus with <hi>Naaman;</hi> and is thus generally, with moſt men who are not of deſperate madneſſe: And, the point is generall (although I ſhall touch it after in a ſpeciall ſence by the text) and applyable both to good and bad. A more wilfull and wicked contrariety hereto, we cannot have then that of <hi>Iehoram</hi> which I named, who thought to fight it out with God, when the famine pinched him, and to kill the Prophet: and yet (to goe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then himſelfe confuting himſelfe) when hee and <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> and a third King went againſt the King of Moab, Cap. 3. and was at a ſtraight like to periſh for lacke of water, both he and the Armies: behold what a change it wrought on the ſudden? For then he ſeekes to the Prophet and bemones the ſtraight in which the Army was, making no other account, but that God might juſtly ſuffer them all to periſh. And when <hi>Eliſha</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to looke at him, yet his fiery ſpirit held it ſelfe in, by compulſion, from any miſdemeanor. So that he muſt bee a monſter of men whom a deepe ſtraight will not ſubdue and tame unto the ſtooping to any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I grant this may ſometime prove only an act of policy, or of carnall feare, and ſo ceaſe. We read of a royall ſpirited Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45715:36"/> of Germany who being wearied with the tyranny of ſundry Popes, and of <hi>Alexander</hi> by name: was at laſt by his roaring Bulls and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications (which in thoſe daies ſcared the greateſt) brought to ſuch an exigent, that he with his Empreſſe and their young ſon, were faine to ſtand 3. daies barefoot at the proud Popes gate: And being after admitted to his preſence, when he was urged to lye proſtrate before him, the Pope trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon his necke, and ſpurning off his Crowne with his foot: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſpirit of the Emperour could have rebelled, and beganne to diſdaine it, yet for policy ſake, he was compelled to deſiſt. Its noted in Judges that when the Ammonites oppreſſed Iſrael: the Elders of Gilead and brethren of <hi>Iptha</hi> (who before had thruſt him out for a baſtard) being in a ſtraight for a Captaine,<note place="margin">Judg. 10.</note> were compelled to goe to <hi>Iptha</hi> to crave his returne, and to undertake the warre; and when he caſt them in the teeth with their former injurious caſting him out, yet the extremity they were in, humbled them, and kept them downe ſo, that they were glad to take ſhame to themſelves, and to begge aide even of that baſtard, when they ſaw their welfare lay bleeding at the ſtake, and none fit to helpe them but himſelfe. Theſe are but common naturall inſtances: yet they lay forth the point thus farre, that the naturall ſpirit of the hautieſt, and moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainefull man toward ſuch as himſelfe, will abate and come downe when an exigent is upon them: And the like may be ſaid of man toward God, when they are laid upon his bayard, and when he hath them upon the hip by any deepe and ſtraight ſore and extremity. Yea, it is true even of Gods owne deare people, already in Covenant with him: whoſe ſlaviſh hearts have often been compelled by Gods Chaines upon them, to forget their jollity and ſenſuall appetite, and to ſtoope to Gods power under their ſtraights. That which I formerly ſpake of the Soveraignty of Gods Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I may here verifie of the outward extremities which he brings us into: Both ſerve to bring downe the heart and to make it humble and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. <hi>Iob</hi> was an holy man, yet ſuch naturall ſcurffe the Lord ſaw to lurke in his ſpirit, that he was faine, by the loſſe of all his ſubſtance, children, health of body, the enmity of his friends, the terrors upon his ſoule, the admonition of <hi>Elihu,</hi> and the Lords owne tawing of him by the view of all his power, and the terror of <hi>Leviathan</hi> and <hi>Behemoth;</hi> at laſt to wring this ſpeech from him, Cap. 42. I abhorre my ſelfe in duſt and aſhes. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> alſo was a godly King,<note place="margin">Job 42.3.</note> but his treaſures and wealth and elbow-roome made him ſo fledge and jolly, that he forgat himſelfe, till the Lord ſmot him with the plague,<note place="margin">Eſay 38.15.</note> put him in feare of his life, and urged him to ſay, I will walke all the reſt of my daies ſoftly, in the bitterneſſe of my ſoule, in the midſt of my houſe. The Lord had him upon the hip, and then he could crouch.<note place="margin">1 King. 19.12.13. Jonah 1. &amp; 2. 1 Sam. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Elija, Iona, David,</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> all holy men, yet till they were frayed with the thunder and earthquake: caſt into the Whales belly, ſtraighted betweene the choice of either famine, warre, or peſtilence, and the like: ſaw not into the frowardneſſe, rebellion, and ſtoutneſſe of their ſpirit.</p>
               <p>But of all others, it is trueſt of ſuch ſpirits as the Lord ſubdues to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and drawes out of a curſed ſinfull courſe. Such as this patterne in our text reſembles, <hi>Naaman</hi> I meane: for although as yet he was not privy to Gods purpoſe towards him in this abaſing of his ſtout heart, yet he was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45715:36"/> (in Gods diſpenſation) now in the way unto it, and by this as a ſtep came to the other. The prodigall (who is a true mirror in all points of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht ſinner and fugitive from God) was faine to be purſued ſo narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the hand of God,<note place="margin">Luk. 14.15.16.</note> that till there was no poſſibility of ſubſiſtence for him any way, he never thinkes of a father, and leſſe of returne, and leaſt of humbling himſelfe. But when hee was brought to an abſolute ſtraight and could no longer hold out, his great ſtomacke and reſolution never to ſee his father, begins to quaile, and then his father began to ſavor with him.</p>
               <p>It is with the ſpirit of a ſinfull Rebell againſt God, as it is with a City beſieged by a ſtrong enemy: but the City having both abundance of outworkes, and ſtrong forts raiſed up, with plenty of proviſion within: beſides ſtore of brave ſouldiers who will ſpend the laſt drop of their heart blood, ere it be ſaid, they are cowards, ſcorne to yeeld their City. But when long time of aſſault, the inſtance and unweariedneſſe of the beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging army, hath battered downe all their forts,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> murdered all their Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with the Canon, beaten downe their Citie over their eares, houſes, Temples, walls: and opened a wider breach for entrance then they can make up againe, beſides the exhauſting of all come and victuall within, and intercepting all ſuccors from without: Then perhaps (when no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe from forraine aide appeares) they will hang out the white flag, and cry for conditions of ſurrender: but before, nothing but ſcorne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance will be admitted. Even ſo is it with the unregenerate ſoule, ſhee pleaſes her ſelfe with her falſe treaſure, the perſwaſion that ſhe is rich and full and happy, and yet perhaps remaines meerely ignorant, or at leaſt in a formall and dangerous eſtate, inſenſible of wrath or danger: This ſtate ſhe findes eaſe in, and when the Lord would hunt her out of it, ſhe ſits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Idolls ſecurely and will not ſtirre:<note place="margin">The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes and forts of the ſoule againſt God.</note> She imbarkes her ſelfe in this error, by the conceit of her wealth, health, youth, outward contents, want of croſſes, credit, good ſucceſſe: how can God hate her, giving her all theſe? if the Lord drive her out of theſe outworkes, yet ſhe runs into ſtronger forts, compares her ſelfe with others worſe then her ſelfe, pleads her civility, innocency of life, good parts, devotions, and moralities: if God ferret her out of this burrow, ſhe will annexe and apply her ſelfe to Chriſt (after a faſhion) for aide, and entrench her ſelfe within her duties, teares, good affections, zealous performances, good opinion of others: if this fort be battered, ſhee will ſtill betake her ſelfe to her ſeeming ſelfe-deniall in many things, forfeit of her will, of ſundry luſts, pleaſures, bad company, and redeeme ſelfe with ſome forfeit of ſelfe: Shee will not bee pulled out of her Caſtle of ſelfe-conceit, nor give up her counterfeit ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency and treaſure within, for any withour, one bird in hand is worth two in the buſh: Till at length, cuſtome and confirmed error doe ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den her, that ſhe will ſooner part with her life, then her falſe happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or reſigne up her bulwarkes and City to Chriſt and his beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Army.</p>
               <p>In ſuch a caſe what muſt the Lord doe?<note place="margin">See Deut. 29.19. The ſiege of God to ſuch a ſoule.</note> Surely either give her quite over as impregnable; and raiſe his ſiege, or elſe reſolve to put her to the uttermoſt ſtraights that can be: Sometime by blaſting her beſt bleſſings, and with ſome deadly diſeaſe taking off the edge of worldly content:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45715:37"/> making her ſoule to loath dainty meate, or putting a ſurfet and fulſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe into all which ſhe enjoyes, that ſhe cannot taſte them: or letting in a veine of vengeance into conſcience, convincing her that all is not well, ſo that nothing can comfort her,<note place="margin">Job 33.14.15.</note> ſhe is Gods enemy, an hypocrite, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleever, wants the promiſe, lives without God in the world, never was humbled, broken, denyed her ſelfe, never was loſt nor forſaken, and therefore never was out of her owne bottome, to live in another ſtocke and roote of Chriſt. When the Lord mixes himſelfe really with croſſes, with terrors, with law, or Goſpell to convince the ſoule either of ſinne, or righteouſneſſe, then ſhe begins to feele a ſtraight, and to be at a loſſe: elſe ſhe is merry: and ſo long as ſhe hath one ragge to cover her filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, one penny in her purſe, one cruſt to gnaw upon, one ſhred to hang by,<note place="margin">Revel. 3.18.</note> ſhe will be cloathed, rich, full, and compleate, Chriſt ſhall never heare of her. It muſt be an hard beſetting with a narrow ſtraight, which ſtrips her, and robbes her of her ſelfe-ſufficiency. Therfore <hi>Elihu (Iob Cap.</hi> 33.) under that one inſtance of ſickneſſe; ſweetly compares the ſtate of an unregenerate perſon before ſtraights come, with the eſtate when they are upon him. Before (ſaith he) God ſpeakes once and twice, by promiſes, and by bleſſings, but man heares like the Adder with a deafe eare: ſhe makes waſh-way of patience, word, conſcience and all. But when the Lord afflicts both Conſcience and body at once, the one with terrours and affrightments in the night (when men ſhould ſleepe) the other with a conſumption in his parts, ſo that his bones ſticke out and clatter, his ſoule loathes dainty meat, his moiſture is ſpent, and the buriers and mourners gape for him: Then, in this ſtraight, if an interpreter come and declare his righteouſneſſe, and ſet him at liberty, he ſhall be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: Why? Oh becauſe God hath aſſwaged his pride! and tamed him ſo, that whereas before he was too high for any man to talke with, now being on the rack, you may have him at any termes, and willing to come to any conditions. Surely ſo it is in any other kinde of ſtraight, whereby the licentious ſpirit of man is ſubdued and ſcared: while that laſteth, the man is in a quite contrary frame, to that he was in at liberty.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45715:37"/> ſo that as <hi>Paul</hi> without the law was jolly and alive, ſo is this living with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any bands or chaines. Now, under a ſtraight it reflects upon it ſelfe ſome ſad notions of feare, ſinne, guilt, wrath, judgement, ſo that the caſe is much changed.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45715:38"/> Judges, is a ſufficient witneſſe: while they were under cruell Lords who vexed them, how importunate were they, time after time to be delivered? what humiliations did they profeſſe,<note place="margin">Judge 10. end with 11.1. &amp;c.</note> and ſhewes of repentance (and no doubt ſelfe meant as it ſpake, but the heart being ſtill it ſelfe, deceived it ſelfe, and mocked God) and being rid of the ſtraight, became worſe Idolaters then before.

But if the Lord himſelfe make the yoke of ſet purpoſe to catch a wilde wretched ſinner and ſtop him in his courſe that he might turne him home: not only the ſtraight, but the word alſo ſhall worke upon conſcience, aſwell as the outward man, and whatſoever the lets are, as ſubtilty, pride, rebellion, the Lord will conquer and ſubdue them to the obedience of faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Explication of the point.</note>To open this a little, conceive it thus. It is with the ſpirituall man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, as with the carnall.

Some compting knowledge to bee an happineſſe, ſeeke that, others honor and preferment, others their eaſe and welfare, others jollity and the pride of life, others reputation and name among men, others long life and proſperity. If they attaine their deſires, they are pitcht, as they would be, and enjoy happineſſe in their attaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But if God croſſe them of their intents; as for example, if he deny the firſt capacity and ability of parts to compaſſe his aimes; if he defeat another, by denying them promotion, and preferring others; if he croſſe a third with the loſſe of health, and perfect ſences, that he taſtes no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in his games and paſtimes, or old age removes him for them: if a fourth bee followed with the diſdaine and ill opinion of the multitude: if a fifth be afflicted with diſeaſes, and be in perill of death: alas! what is their life worth? being robbed of their whelpes, their life is but weariſome, they are at a ſet, joyleſſe, and out of heart. As a mizer having loſt his treaſure, or an ambitious favorit out of his Princes favor, are like <hi>Nabals,</hi> their hearts dye like a ſtone in them. Onely by this they can helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that as it was their miſery to chuſe ſuch baſe objects; ſo it is their ſubtilty, when they are defeated of the one, they turne to another. As if learning faile, then runne to preferment; if that faile, to eaſe, to pleaſure, to mony, or the like, and all becauſe the ſoule loaths a ſtraight: So is it with him who is enlightned and convinced in conſcience. When once the Lord by his law or terrors, convicts a man, that although he attaine whatſoever his heart deſires, yet he hath gotten but a fading Paradiſe, hee hath no more then an hel-hound may have: he hath nothing which can quiet the appetite of the ſoule which is immortall: I ſay, when ſuch a light comes into the ſoule, telling him the miſery of all he hath, and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a man that hath that which he wants, Chriſt and pardon, grace &amp; heaven: how can it be, but ſuch a man lying thus convinced, muſt needs be as a man ſtabd &amp; ſlaine, bereft of all his fooles Paradiſe at once? But if ſuch anone hearing of a better happineſſe, will play the hypocrite, diſſemble a kinde of religion, make himſelfe demure and holy, preciſe and zealous in the worſhip of God, and yet ſtill hold his former erronious happineſſe,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45715:38"/> coloured over with ſome devotion, deſtitute of any better principle to ſettle upon, what is this, but to get out of his preſſure by a falſe indirect way, and ſo deprive himſelfe of the true end of his conviction, which is to caſt out his old principle, and bottome himſelfe upon an new? But to what tends all this? The ſumme of all is, that a ſtraight and preſſure when the Lord is the maker of it and the holder of it on: is a ſpeciall meanes to pul down the heart before God, &amp; to force it to ſeek conditions of peace, upon Gods owne termes (be they never ſo difficult) and that to avoide a greater incombrance. For why? The Lord is able by this meane not only to ſubdue corrupt ſelfe by his law, but alſo religious ſelfe, erronious and deluded ſelfe by his Goſpell: and ſo to tranſlate the ſoule meerely from a falſe bottome to a ſound, whatſoever it coſt him. But where the Lord and the Spirit of the Word attends not ſuch ſtraights, although in an extremity, the heart is beſet and ſtraighted, yet afterward it will ſlip the collar: and in the meane time, will uſe all trickes and ſhifts (as the poore creature hard hunted, and in danger) to avoide the trouble, yea it will turne it ſelfe into a thouſand guiſes and devices, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then leave her old trade, and cleave to a promiſe.</p>
               <p>I come to the uſe. And firſt it might be inſtruction and admonition to ſuch of us, as goe for the forwardeſt Chriſtians.<note place="margin">Uſe 1. of Inſtruct.</note> Inſtruction firſt to teach us to adore the wiſedome of our God in the adminiſtration of the times in which we live in. The word ſeemes to have done working upon the conſciences of the moſt, few are gaſtred by the terrors thereof, few ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by the promiſes, few are ſenſible active watchfull walkers. I doubt not but God hath his jewells in corners, his ſecret ones, whoſe hearts and waies lye cloſe to him, in theſe degenerate times. But for the body of hearers, either to bee converted or (in appearance) converted already, ſtrange it is what a numbe palſey, what a Laodicean temper of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, eaſe, and ſelfe-love hath covered us over: ſcarce one in a long time gaſtred out of his neaſt of forme or profaneneſſe: and ſuch as are, keepe their conſciences at ſuch looſe termes, that few can diſcerne them to be under the Banner or authority of any Soveraigne. Now what doth the Lord? Surely he is faine to lay men upon the bayard, and to afflict them with one yoke or other, either perſonall or generall ſtraights. Selfe-love hath over-growne all, that except God ſtept out of his ordinary path of ſpeaking, to doing, and did cauſe each face to waxe pale, and each hand to be on the pained plat: ſome by poverty, others by debt, or impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or loſſes, or reproach, or purſuite of enemies, malicious tongues, unreaſonable men, deſperate unfaithfulneſſe, treachery and injuriouſneſſe of ſuch as they live with: Sure it is, the word would worke but little upon us.

To gaſter the conſciences of ſome who were never awakened, by ſome outward ſtraights; hardneſſe to live, banqueruptneſſe and ruine of eſtate, beggery and miſery: others by ſearching trialls and extremities, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they muſt carry their lives and ſtates, gifts and hopes in their boſomes ready to let out, or elſe they muſt proſtitute their conſciences to ſinne and treachery? yes ſurely: or elſe he knowes (if we might be let alone) we would grow to the formality, ſoftneſſe, ſecurity, commons and fulſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of others who have no ſparke of grace in them. But now perhaps being ſearcht to the quicke, and put to it, we dare not for ſhame lay our names at the ſtake of perpetuall reproach, by giving God quite over: now perhaps, we will ſhake our ſelves and ſay, ſhall ſuch an one as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray God? ſhall I pollute his worſhip? ſhall I defile that truth which I have received incorrupt from others? ſhall I helpe to deſtroy Gods lawe, deface the power of goodneſſe? ſort my ſelfe with ſuch as are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſeparate my ſelfe from my brethren? No ſure: I wiſh I had looked to it ſooner; yet better late then never: At laſt I will give witneſſe to God to his truth, honor, ſervants, Sabbaths: I will no longer give aime to the religion of theſe times, their ſapleſſe, dead and powerleſſe profeſſion: my ſoule loathes it: I long to reprove and confute all Popiſh, Pelagian, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, and formall religion: and therefore let parts, let eaſe, let liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, preferment, honor, gifts, outward proſperity goe where they will, my darling I will not loſe, I will not bite off that precious ſtone (for which I am hunted) and caſt it to the hounds, to ſave my life: But I am reſolved (through mercy) to my uttermoſt to juſtifie the power of truth, both in my judgement and practice. Oh it is the wiſedome of God to ſend ſuch ſtraights and ſnares among us, for the diſcovery of hypocrites and baſe counterfeits! and for the exerciſe of that ſecret grace in his owne which elſe through eaſe and ſelfe-love would ruſt and cankerfret.</p>

If <hi>Naaman</hi> had reſted in this, his crouching at the Prophets gate, under the diſeaſe he felt, he had never been cured: and yet, even this was one ſtep to pull downe his ſtomacke. We ſee that when hee was put to it in the next verſe, he raged, (as baſe as he ſeemed here.) A Lion is a Lion ſtill, both couchant, and rampant.

Becauſe he was, where he would not be: and ſeekes to be where his delight is. A proud, carnall heart, vaine, and loving ſenſuall objects, may be held from them a time: and for the while (in ſome reſpects) thinke its well that its free from the tyranny of ſome luſts, for the noyſomeneſſe ſake: But when it can have liberty to them, and be let out to old objects of vanity, pride, and ſenſuality, it prefers it rather, becauſe the conſtitution of it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo: I ſay therefore, reſt not in ſuch an eſtate. Conſider how end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it is to ſtrive with a body of evill, by a few pangs of actuall diſtaſte, and violent reſtraint? Thinke with thy ſelfe, how little thou haſt prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by all this courſe, and that it will be a work ever to do; till the Lord binde the ſoule to her good behaviour, by putting goodneſſe into it, and cauſing it to behave it ſelfe well: it is but as the damming up of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtreame, which will have her courſe.

               <p>The Lord begins with violence, but ends in ſweetneſſe: the ſpirit of grace working a principle of delight in the ſoule,<note place="margin">But to work a change in the ſoule, and to turn it to God.

Beg then of the Lord, that thy preſſure may not be remooved, till it have left the print of mercy behinde it, and brought thee, ſo under graces command, that thou maieſt wholly be the Lords. Princes arreſt their ſubjects, for ſome debts, fines, forfeits, or ſervices due to themſelves; which being paid, the party is at his owne liberty. But the Lord doth not ſo: hee arreſts not a man, to bring him upon his knees, to wring from him ſome tearmes of homage; but to ſubdue the whole man, and the principle of the minde, will and frame to himſelfe. Concurre with this end of good, and proſper. But, if it be thus, the effects will ſhew it: for then,<note place="margin">Effects of change will ſhew it.</note> not onely the ſtoutneſſe of the heart and the rebellion of it are held under by ſtrong hand for a time; but, the ſubtilty thereof is truly turned to ſimplicity, the eaſe, ſloth of it, into diligence; the indifferency of it, into earneſtneſſe, the weariſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it into reſtleſſeneſſe and diligence, the inconſtancy of it into ſtableneſſe, the acts and pangs of it into habits, and principles, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, into liberty and holy delight, to ſubmit it ſelfe both to the way of beleeving, and the fruite of ſubjection and deniall of it ſelfe, both in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall and evangelicall reſpects. And ſo much for this doctrine, ſo far as the ſcope of it will beare. I might enter into further matter, both to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the infinite tricks of a falſe heart, to nouzle it ſelfe in a corrupt eſtate: and the trialls and waies, whereby the Lord ſets ſuch an heart at liberty; But I foreſee, that the points following, will better occaſion theſe things, and therefore, I onely make this doctrine a preparative to them</p>
               <p>Now I proceed to the ſecond doctrine out of theſe words.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> Whom God meanes to convert, them he firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and means.</note> 
                  <hi>That Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man comes and ſtands at the doore of Eliſha.</hi> And that is this, That whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Lord intends to bring home, and convert to himſelfe, he will order all meanes moſt ſweetly and agreeingly, to that purpoſe. We ſee, <hi>Naaman</hi> and his retinue brought to the doore of <hi>Eliſha:</hi> But how? ſurely by the providence of the ſame God, who had purpoſed his converſion, he is brought to the meanes, to waite and expect the ſeaſon of it. And all things (we ſee) fall out and concurre aptly, to it. Firſt <hi>Naaman</hi> is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with a loathſome diſeaſe, that under the hope of curing that, hee might make an errand to the Prophet, whom he had not elſe viſited. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a maide muſt be taken and the Aramites muſt fight, and take her, place her with <hi>Naamans</hi> wife; the maide muſt know,<note place="margin">Paſſages of Gods preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amans caſe.</note> and be able to report of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> to her miſtriſſe, <hi>Naaman</hi> muſt aſcribe credit to her; and all theſe muſt concurre that he might hearken after <hi>Eliſha.</hi> Thirdly, letters muſt be eroneouſly ſent to <hi>Iehoram,</hi> that <hi>Eliſha</hi> might thereby cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect an errour, and turne him to himſelfe, which elſe had not bin. And laſtly, <hi>Naaman</hi> hearing of the Prophet, muſt forthwith repaire unto him, and not expect till <hi>Eliſha</hi> tend upon him, elſe he had miſſed of his cure. All theſe occurrents God moſt wiſely orders and rules for the ends he intended: ſo that the one could no more be defeated then the other; if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one had failed, the effect might have ceaſed.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of the converſion of <hi>Oneſimus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proofes of the point. Epiſt. to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</note> who had plaid the thiefe to his Maſter <hi>Philemon:</hi> God meant he ſhould bee converted by <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtery. Lo, how doth the Lord order the meanes unto it? He doth not inſtill falſhood and flight into him, but he orders it: He over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45715:42"/> him in his journey, that hee might not peake aſide into this corner or that, but goe to <hi>Paul,</hi> and lighting upon him, might by ſome direct and ſeaſonable ſpeech from him, be turned from his falſhood to God. So in the caſe of <hi>Cornelius:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 10.</note> The Lord meant to ſettle him (being a good Proſelite) in the faith of the Lord Jeſus. The inſtrument by whom, was <hi>Peter.</hi> How ſhould he know of him, or where to come by him? The Lord in a viſion intimates it to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and he ſends to Joppe to <hi>Simon.</hi> But <hi>Peter</hi> was armed with a minde to reject their errand, becauſe he was a Jew, and <hi>Cornelius</hi> a Gentile. True: But, immediately before their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, the Lord rectifies <hi>Peter,</hi> and frames him to goe by a viſion of all crawling vermin in a cleane ſheet, which <hi>Peter</hi> was bidden to eate: and, refuſing to doe ſo, was commanded not to eſteeme that uncleane, which the Lord had made cleane. No ſooner is <hi>Peter</hi> rectified, but they knock: and he is prepared to goe with them, comes, findes all ready, and converts <hi>Cornelius.</hi> To conclude, thus it is with the Eunuch of Candace: He paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by that way,<note place="margin">Acts 8.</note> where <hi>Philip</hi> preached, the Spirit prompts him to joyne himſelfe to that Charet. When he comes, he findes him reading in <hi>Eſay</hi> a peece of a Prophecie, cap. 53. concerning Chriſts generation: and, not knowing the ſenſe, askes <hi>Philip;</hi> who takes occaſion thereby to open to him the whole myſtery of Chriſt, and convinces him of the truth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he is converted. I heape up no more examples. Reade the paſſages of Acts 9.<note place="margin">Acts 9.</note> in <hi>Saul.</hi>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>1</label> There be many reaſons of the point. 1. As the Lord is the firſt mover of the vaſt frame of this world, and the maine changes of whole States, Churches and Kingdomes, their ſtableneſſe and proſperity, their decay and ruine, the great affaires of warre, peace, and government: ſo eſpecially, he ſits at the ſterne of his Church. If he meane to puniſh it, he acts and animates the wayes to bring it to paſſe, and the inſtruments of his wrath. Though the King of Aſhur,<note place="margin">Reade Eſay 10.7.</note> meant no other but to ſpoile and make wreck, yet God uſed him onely as his rod of vengeance. And, as he meant to ſcatter thoſe ten Tribes for their horrible idolatry:<note place="margin">1 King. 12.13</note> ſo he orders the whole frame of premiſes tending thereto: He divides the Kingdomes of <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> and <hi>Ieroboam.</hi> He ſuffers that ſnare of Diviſion to cut off the tenne Tribes from Juda, and her worſhip, Temple and ſacrifices: To deviſe an idolatrous worſhip of Calves. He plagues them with a ſucceſſion of 3 or 4 curſed families and their of-ſpring, <hi>Ieroboam, Baaſha, Omri, Iehu:</hi> and, after them, left them to a moſt deſperate government of Uſurpers, <hi>Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> and the reſt, till the whole nation was carried away into perpetuall Captivity. And, when it pleaſed him to redeeme his Church, he alſo acted the ſpirits of thoſe inſtruments of deliverance, as, after the 70 yeares Captivity,<note place="margin">2 Chr. 36.22. Ezra 1.2. Ezra 6.6.</note> he ſtirred up the ſpirit of <hi>Darius, Aſſuerus, Cyrus,</hi> and others, to begin and perfect his project. Nay, not onely ſo, but, there is no act concerning the welfare of his, but he orders it. He foreſeeing the family of <hi>Iacob</hi> muſt (els) periſh for food, long before layes to prevent it, in the antecedents of it:<note place="margin">Gen. 35.5. &amp; 25. &amp; Gen. 45.7. Gen. 41.14.</note> Suffers <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to dreame an odious dreame, his brethren to ſell him to <hi>Putiphar,</hi> his wife to attempt, accuſe, and impriſon him, the two priſoners to propound their dreames, and receive ſatisfaction, <hi>Pharao</hi> in the diſtreſſe of his ſpirit to heare of him in that reſpect, to conſult with, and reſolve himſelfe by him, to promote him to be chiefe in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45715:42"/> under him, cauſes <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to prepare and ſtore up corne, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves <hi>Iacob</hi> and his ſons. All this whole frame hee himſelfe confeſſes to be from God; you (ſaith he) intended evill to me, but the Lord intended greater things, even to preſerve the lives of his Church. That great worke of Redemption by the Lord Jeſus had one main paſſage in it,<note place="margin">Luke 2.1.</note> That Chriſt muſt be borne at Bethlehem. <hi>Mary</hi> was now big, and dwelt at Nazaret. But, the Lord cauſes <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> to taxe all the world, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all the Jewes to repaire to the City of their nativity and family. This charge being exact, poore <hi>Mary</hi> muſt carry her bigge body thither: and, there travaile of Chriſt. Nothing could hinder. <hi>Saul</hi> muſt be the King, whom in wrath, God appoints over diſcontented Iſrael: To this end, the Aſſes muſt goe aſtray, he muſt ſeeke them, be in a ſtrait, goe to <hi>Samuel,</hi> and he warned of God, muſt meet him,<note place="margin">1 Sam 9.2. &amp; 19.</note> there <hi>Saul</hi> receives the meſſage, and is anointed. Now marke, the reaſon: If the Lord be thus in all thoſe events which concerne his Church in the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nerall, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall onely, how much more ſhall he appeare, to bee active in the moſt excellent part of all other, <hi>viz.</hi> his drawing home all ſuch to himſelfe as belong to his Election? Surely as the act is the moſt eminent peece of all other Providence, ſo God his activeneſſe, and powerfull concurrence thereto, (in ſwaying all premiſes to inferre the concluſion of his Purpoſe) muſt be moſt eminently ſeene in that above all others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the effecting of the ſubſtance of their converſion whom <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> he hath elected, muſt flow from his grace and power, then much more the accommodating of all ſuch antecedents as conduce thereto, muſt be from his direction. But ſo it is, the ſubſtance of the meanes is from him, he calls home all whom he hath elected, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. The enlightning of them by the word, the humbling, the breaking of heart, the perſwading of them to beleeve is from him. How much more the ordering and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of circumſtances, according of occaſions, accidents, times, perſons, and the like, muſt alſo be aſcribed to his moſt divine diſpenſation?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the Lord ſhould leave his owne ends at randon, to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> by the will and arbitrement of inſtruments occaſions, left to their owne pleaſure and choice: then ſhould the infallible purpoſe of God, hang upon the mutable and caſuall actions of ſuch inſtruments, and the raſh concourſe of liveleſſe occaſions, which cannot act or bring together themſelves, to produce any ſuch effect. And by conſequent ſuch effects ſhould faile. Which becauſe it is impoſſible, therefore of neceſſity muſt both be ſubject to the over-ruling power of the Purpoſer: determining ſome, and conjoyning others, wills I meane of men, or accidentall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to the infallible effecting of the converſion of ſuch as hee hath choſen.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we know, the end being once ſet downe in the minde, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>4</label> and directeth the whole frame of thoſe things which make toward it: if a man have propounded to himſelfe a purpoſe to marry, to build, to travell: the Idea of theſe ends ſtill enliveth the obſervation of all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and opportunities, which a man meets with, and draweth all, to the attainment of ſuch ends. Where ſuch ends are not propoſed, the minde is quiet, and ordereth no occaſions tending that way. Thus it is with the Lord: The end once being determined, that ſtirreth, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45715:43"/> his wiſedome and providence, to fore-lay all meanes, which tend thereto; I meane the converſion of the poore ſoule. I do not make Gods and mans intentions like, in all points, but illuſtrate the one by the other. The difference between them is large: for firſt, mens ends are before their enterpriſes, and they are ſucceſſive alſo, here one meane offers it ſelfe to promote their end, there another. Not ſo in the Lord, who perfectly and at once (though orderly) doth both determine his ends, and contrive his meanes,<note place="margin">Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fight &amp; mans differ much.</note> and beholds the effecting of the one in the other, neceſſarily and unfallibly: Gods meanes never faile him in his projects, whereas man for lacke of ſufficient fore-caſt and proviſion, is diſappointed farre oftner then he ſucceeds. Men may ſo concurre to their owne ends, in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, as to uſe ſinfull inſtruments ſinfully, partaking with them in their evils: But the Lord, although he oft uſe ſinfull occaſions and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and inſtruments to compaſſe his ends, yet hee concurres not to their ſinne, but onely diſpoſeth and over-ruleth it to good: As the Lord uſed <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and <hi>Iehu's</hi> ambitious deſires to effect the overthrow of the houſes of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> and <hi>Ahab.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Kings 13. Acts 9.1.</note> So he uſed the ſinne of <hi>Saul</hi> to bee an occaſion of his deeper humiliation;<note place="margin">Acts 2.39. Acts 18.</note> and the ſinne of the Jewes, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. who mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the Lord of life, to prick and break their hearts the more eaſily by <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon. So the Jaylors deſperateneſſe, cruelty and rage againſt the Apoſtles, to convince him the more, deeply convincing him afterwards. So much for reaſons.</p>

                  </label> But here a queſtion may be asked, In what ſort the Lord may bee ſaid to act, and accord all meanes which may ſerve to compaſſe his end in this kinde?</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> I anſwer: It is hard to ſet downe the variety of wayes by which the Lord worketh: yet ſome few of the moſt uſuall I may mention. Firſt and eſpecially this:<note place="margin">
                     <p>Gods preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wherein they ſtand, and in what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                     <p>The firſt branch.</p>
                     <p>God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules, diverts our intents to ſerve his.</p>
                  </note> That the Lord over-rules, and diverts, and alters the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of men, that whenas they intend one thing, hee intends another, either croſſing their owne, to effect his, or wrapping in theirs within his owne, as moſt prevailing and chiefe. Thus did the Lord here in <hi>Naamans</hi> caſe. He dreamt of nothing leſſe then any cure of ſoule: yet the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it as chiefe, and caſts him in the other as an over-plus. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> diſcourſing of his converſion to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> Acts 26.<note place="margin">Acts 26.</note> tells him hee was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a Purſivant with a Bouget of Letters to Damaſcus, to apprehend the Saints there: But the Lord (who had ſeparated him to a farre other end, even to be a choſen veſſell of grace, and an Apoſtle to carry his Name to the Gentiles) caſt him downe from his Palfrey, ſmote him to the ground, and amazed him, till hee had throughly ſubdued him under his owne will and government. Herein ſhewing himſelfe to bee as <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph. 3.<note place="margin">Epeſ. 3.15.</note> calles him, the Father of all the families of the Earth. For as the Maſter of a family over-rules his ſervants will and buſineſſe; and, when he intends one worke in an ordinary courſe of ſervice, his Maſter hath ſome other buſineſſe of greater conſequence to ſend him about, and ſo the ſervant is acted by his maſter to forbeare the one, and diſpatch the other; ſo is it here in the great worke of ſalvation. Many a man uſeth to make an ordinary worke of going to a place where the Word is preached: hee aimes at buſineſſe, or company, or novelties, or perhaps cavilling at the Miniſter: The Lord aimes at fetching him within his net, that hee may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45715:43"/> his purpoſe, and draw him to converſion. Not onely as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith Cap. 65.1. The Lord is found of ſuch as ſought him not: that is prevents the thoughts which were roving helward, worldward, and ſinward,<note place="margin">Job 33. Eſay 65.1.</note> to thinke of matters of greater conſequence, even heaven and happineſſe: But (which is more) when they perhaps purpoſed to croſſe with God (as <hi>Paul</hi> did) the Lords intents overrule mans, and turne him the way which himſelfe intends. As old <hi>Eli,</hi> overrules <hi>Samuels</hi> feelineſſe, and ſaith, if he call againe, ſay, ſpeake, for thy ſervant heareth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Lord where he meanes to convert, will mightily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power the ſoule from ſtumbling at ſuch diſcouragements,<note place="margin">Overpowers the ſoule from ſtumbling at diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> and obſtacles <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>2</label> that ſtand in the way. This argues God ſpecially preſent, and to have a finger in the worke. When another ſhall be a divell to himſelfe, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelfe from God by caſting the difficulties, alleadging farmes, oxen and wife to hold him off: and, by framing to himſelfe many Lions in the way, ſo that if he goes, yet it is as a Beare to the ſtake, to heare the word, if he heares once, he neglects oft: lo, when God ſtirs his heart, he ſhall feel ſuch a ſtrong, perpetuall moover within him; that theſe are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, with him, he beats them off as flies, he feeles ſuch a fire of purpoſe, and bent in his heart, to ſeeke after God, as if he thought, ſome pearle were there to be had: he cannot finde in his heart, to leave off hearing, praying, muſing, queſtioning, and uſing all helpes, which are in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, till he have felt the worke of them, in himſelfe. <hi>Naaman</hi> heere had his diſmaiments: yet the Lord by a ſecret hand of his owne, held him on, aſſwaged his rage, and ſet his ſervants on worke,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.17 Act. 9</note> till he had effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the cure. When the Lord had <hi>Paul</hi> on the hooke once, he ſuffered him not to ſlug out the worke, till he had finiſhed it. Act. 9.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Lord diſpoſes of all outward occaſions,<note place="margin">He diſpoſes of all outward occaſions, both remooving them which let, and fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them which helpe.</note> which lead to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>3</label> his ends and both remooves the oppoſites, and accomodates, unites and chaines together the meanes, that the end be not fruſtrated. Notable is that I noted Act. 10. of <hi>Peter,</hi> who was no way like to goe with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> as being an heathen: what doth the Lord? workes <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> heart from that objection, and ſo from unwillingneſſe: nay, more, he doth make the one privy to the others want, and, as in a viſion, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw <hi>Ananias</hi> comming toward him, to open his eies, ſo on the other ſide <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi> in a viſion, is informed of <hi>Pauls</hi> praying, and waiting upon the Lord for remedy. God brings both together, and ſutes the one with wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to be holpen, and the other with readineſſe to helpe: &amp; ſo, they were mutually fitted to do and receive good, each to, and from other. So in <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe when he was to go to <hi>Ananias,</hi> how unwilling was he to be the inſtrument of ſettling &amp; ſatisfying him? Therefore the Lord ſteps in, and remooves that let, and tells him, he is a ſpeciall man for his own uſe.</p>
               <p>So oftimes when parents, friends, Miniſter himſelfe are diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to a poore novice; how doth the Lord (foreſeeing ſuch a blur) turne the eies of Crocodiles, to Doves eyes, alleniate, and draw the hearts of fathers to the children? what faire way doth he open? Againe, how doth the Lord diſpoſe of ſuch requiſite circumſtances as concurre to the ends, without which, it could not have been effected? Sometime by bringing a man into ſuch a place, or Towne, where a faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry reſideth, ſometimes into ſome ſuch family, where the name of God
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45715:44"/> is called upon faithfully, ſometime preparing for a man ſuch a dwelling as is compaſſed about with good neighbours, whoſe example and helpe may be a loadſtone unto him,<note place="margin">John 4.</note> as the woman of Samaria (being her ſelfe firſt drawne from her ſcoffing to beleeving) drew all her kindred: So of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the Lord by ſhaking one maine Pillar-ſtone in an houſe, cauſes many little ſtones to rattle downe after. So many a young Scholler by a godly Tutor, many a young youth or maid by a religious Maſter or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, many an ignorant novice, by marrying a good wife or husband, and, into a godly family, growes to be religious. All theſe are gracious preventions. And from the ſame preventing mercy it is, that the Chaine and Coherence of the meanes, one after another, is ſo united and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by the Lord, that whereas the breaking off of any one, might ſplit and marre the frame; the Lord holds all together, for the effecting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. As here, except all the foure premiſes had held, <hi>Naaman</hi> might have beene eaſily defeated of his iſſue. But the Lord ſuffers no one linke of the chaine to breake.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Lord moſt aptly and fitly accommodates all circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>4</label> by his providence, to conſort and combine to ſuch ends: diſpoſing of apt condition,<note place="margin">Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances fittly to the end.</note> age, ſeaſon, perſon, place and other opportunities. If <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> (being ſo great) had not beene made little by the condition of a leper, could he have ſtooped ſo low as the Prophet? All are not ſo fit to bee dealt with, by every inſtrument: ſome, more are drawne by a ſtill and ſoftly voice, others by the thundring of terror: the Lord ſuits meet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to meet objects, that ſo the worke might goe forward. Not alway the ſame perſon, is apt to bee wrought upon, by all occaſions: As when the minde is filled with buſineſſe, all that is ſpoken, is as it were ſpoken in a mans caſt.<note place="margin">Luke 10.40.</note> 
                  <hi>Martha,</hi> being cumbred with much ſerving, was as a full veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, for the time, all which had beene put into her had run over: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Mary,</hi> whoſe minde was free and empty, was fitter to ſit at Chriſts feet, and profit. All places are not alike, to all ſorts: While children live under their Parents wing, at eaſe and liberty, they minde nothing, that good is: perhaps, being abroad; and being put to it, marked, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their converſation and behaviour, ſeeing that the world is hard, and living under ſtrict government; they begin to looke about them, and to digeſt thoſe counſells, which they have long beene taught. Every age is not ſo capable: when yeares have hardened a man in his evill courſe, he is farre worſe to be wrought upon; then in his younger time, having leſſe experience of evill. So that the Lord takes men in the fitteſt ſeaſon, in youth, and prevents the unfitteſt, and ſo for all other circumſtances.</p>

It is not in man to order his owne way: the heart and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of men are their owne, but the diſpoſitions thereof are from the Lord: as the iſſues, ſo the preparations to life, and death, are in his hand. It is no priviledge of a Prince over his ſubjects, nor of a parent over his children, nor of husband over wife: They have authority to over-rule the bodies, the outward behaviour and duties of ſuch as are under them. But for the ſecret over-ſwaying of intentions, and turning them from their owne to his way, it is onely the Lords prerogative. It is with mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, as with the body of a man in a ſhip who walkes upon the hatches from Eaſt to Weſt: Yet the motion of the ſhip being contrary, carries the man the way of her owne motion nevertheleſſe.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS poore Pilgrime, and patient <hi>Naaman,</hi> as yee have heard (beloved) hath ſtood ſome time at the Prophets doore, denying himſelfe, and his eſteeme,<note place="margin">Entry upon the ſubſtance of the miracle.</note> honour and favour with his Prince: he and his train ſubmitting themſelves, and ſtanding at the courteſie of God and his Prophet for his cure. And, although we heare of no words, or ſuit comming from him, yet his very habit and ſtanding, in the deep ſilence of it, ſpeaketh and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth aloud for the Prophets helpe. And indeed, it had been hard-hearted and unmercifull for <hi>Eliſha</hi> (having himſelf ſent for him to his houſe, when he was wildred) ſeeing how humble his ſuppliant is, to have let him to ſtand as a dumb pageant, without ſalutation. Courteſie and morals could not have denied him that favour: and much more that Spirit wherewith the Prophet was filled, a ſpirit of mildneſſe, mercie, exorableneſſe and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe to be intreated of a petitioner ſo miſerable, and comming ſo farre for helpe: muſt needs hearken to his requeſt. This verſe therefore ſhewes us, what meſſage <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſends him to the doore. And now (at this third Sermon) weare paſſed the Antecedent occaſions leading us to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Cure: and are come to the chiefe ſubſtance of the ſtory. Whereof to make a full Analyſe all at once, becauſe it would clog the hearers memory, therefore we thinke it here ſuperfluous, onely wee will ſeverall the ſtory into her branches, opening the firſt of them, here in our entrance upon it, but for the reſt we will referre them to the threſhold of their particular handlings, that every thing may be more lively and better remembred. The whole ſtory then hath theſe five diſtinct parts: The
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45715:49"/> firſt <hi>Eliſha</hi> his meſſage ſent to <hi>Naaman</hi> ſtanding at his gate, and full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and that in this tenth verſe. The ſecond is <hi>Naamans</hi> entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſtruction of it,<note place="margin">The generall heads of the ſtory, five.</note> and how it tooke with him, and that in the eleventh and twelfth verſes. The third generall is, the Rejoynder of his poore ſervants upon their maſters miſconſtruction of the meſſage, and that containes their loyall and ſerious treatie and counſell of wiſer interpretation, and for better carriage: that in the 13. verſe: The fourth is the iſſue and happineſſe of all: the ſweet concluſion of a ſad en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and that is, that upon the overture and intimation of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (or rather of grace) he changes his former reſolution to be gone, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an obedient ſubmiſſion to waſh in Jordan. The fifth and laſt, the iſſue of his obedience: partly immediate, that hee found the Prophet true, hee was inſtantly cleanſed, his fleſh returning as a young childes: partly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, and conſequent upon it: in his returne from Jordan to the Prophets houſe, and making his reſpective acknowledgement: in his zealous and loving offer of recompence: in his earneſt though weak devotion: in his firm &amp; full reſolution of future cloſing with God: in his tender and moſt ſenſible touch of heart for the ſin which mainly pinched him: with requeſt for advice about it for time to come: whereto the loving anſwer of the Prophet is annexed; Go in peace. Theſe are the parts, Firſt of the firſt, in this tenth verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The firſt of the five gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls. Branches of the tenth verſe three.</note>There is no great difficultie in the words: That which is, may be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the opening of the heads of doctrine ariſing out of them. And they are three in order: Firſt, that <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſends a meſſenger, but comes not out in perſon to <hi>Naaman:</hi> that concernes the manner and way of <hi>Eliſha</hi> his anſwering. The ſecond concernes the matter of his anſwer, Goe, and waſh ſeven times in Jordan: A meſſage ſtill harping upon the former ſtring tending to vindicate all the glory to God, by ſubſtituting of ſuch a creature, as could ſteale no honour from God. The third iſſues from a queſtion, That ſeeing God aimed at his owne glory, to which end hee would uſe ſtill the creature in the cure: The anſwer to which is, the Lord having bound ſure enough for himſelfe and his owne glory, in ſo poore a creature, and unlikely healer, as waters: doth yet in a ſort provide for <hi>Naaman</hi> afterwards: viz. That whereas there was implied in this charge, a gracious promiſe that he ſhould be healed, the Prophet would confirme his weake faith in the promiſe and unſeen power of God, by the reall ſigne of a thing to be ſeen and felt, even the waters of Jordan. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhortly premiſed for diſtinctneſſe of the point, let us open the firſt of them, and the ground of that which floweth thence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eliſha</hi> (we ſee) comes not himſelfe, but ſends his meſſenger. Why? I pray you.<note place="margin">The firſt point in this. It was not pride or ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe in Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha to deny treaty with Naaman.</note> Was it for ſtate, and ſurlineſſe? No ſurely. That had been a very indirect meane, to have cured pride, or ſelfe-love in <hi>Naaman:</hi> or to have drawne him out of himſelfe to one above himſelfe. Popiſh arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie, and Phariſaicall pride of Miniſters, thinking to hold men at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine diſtance toward their greatneſſe, recompenceth not, nor attaines Gods righteouſneſſe. That proud Prelate, and man of finne, who ſetteth up himſelf above all that is called God, and under a title of the Vicarſhip of Chriſt, playes the Antichriſt: who hath magnified himſelfe hitherto, and enlarged his territoties by an outward ſetting up himſelfe with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45715:49"/> pomp in the eyes of a deluded multitude of ſuperſtitious fooles: hath yet never wonne any honour in the ſoules and conſciences of men, but rather made himſelf to ſtink in mens noſtrils through his intolerable inſolencie. His treading upon Emperours neckes, kicking off their Crownes,<note place="margin">Popiſh inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie over Gods people intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</note> dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them by excommunication, forcing them to lackey him on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and holding his ſtirrop: His making a reall, eſſentiall difference of himſelfe from other Biſhops and Miniſters: holding then at ſtaves end, dancing attendance upon his haughtineſſe (Holineſſe I ſhould ſay) mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, weekes, dayes and yeares, ere audience can be given: ſcorning the Laity as accurſed. This pride, though it have kept up his Satanicall ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny through feare and terrour in the hearts of Idolaters; yet hath made him and his doctrine, life and manners, execrably odious. For why? it is as contrary to Chriſts humbleneſſe, as the ſtate of one mounted upon a Spaniſh Jennet, is contrary to the meanneſſe of one riding on an Aſſe: and that by the confeſſion even of ſome of his owne ſtraine. So that, when his Meſſenger <hi>Auguſtine</hi> came here firſt into England, in his name and pride, to ſubdue our Britany to Popiſh yoke: the poore Monkes of Bangor ſummoned to appeare to his preſence, beholding the baſe pride of his ſeat, raiſed throne-wiſe above the ordinary ſeats of others: even by his Maſters ear-marke he was ſmelt and diſcarded as a proud uſurper, and no commer with an Apoſtles ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Which I ſpeake not as if I would from hence raiſe any doctrine from a negative ground:<note place="margin">No doctrines from nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</note> but leſt the queſtion ſhould bee reſolved without ſome obſervation, this I would ſay to our ſelves of the Clergie,<note place="margin">By the way yet, ſome clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the doubt, and an hint of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes towards our people is the trueſt &amp; ſureſt preſervative of our honor intire in their ſouls. State, and diſtance may ſet us up in the ſenſe of ſome ignorant ones, who rather ſlaviſhly feare us, then love us (and yet even theſe, when they utter their thoughts, will give us their livery:) But as for thoſe who know how to value a Miniſter of God in the name and for the worke of a Prophet, nothing more honours a Preacher in their hearts, then his humility. I deny not, but there ought to be due reſpect of people to their Miniſter: but I deny that it is purchaſed by auſterity and ſtatelines: And yet I do not allow a Miniſter to be haile fellow well met with each companion: nor, to avoyd the extreame of ſtatelineſſe with another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame of commonneſſe, complying with them in the Ale-houſe, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or boon-fellowſhips: to hang about their ſhop-windowes, &amp; mixe himſelfe with them in his paper-ſervice at all turns, buyings, bargaines, wills, purchaſes (except in a pious and neceſſary way of Chriſtian love.) But, by the authority of his labours, and the integrity of his life, to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that eſteeme which is meet for a diſpenſer or Chriſt: and, in this ſenſe we ought to ſee that no man deſpiſe us. But yet, on the other ſide,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.15.</note> we muſt not over-Lord it among them, to bring them under our girdles,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.3.</note> and to boaſt our ſelves as the beſt men in the towne: for ſo ſhall wee but out-ſhoot the Divell in his owne bow, and ſhew our ſelves diſtruſtfull of Gods providence, as if he were not able to bring forth our light,<note place="margin">Pſa. 37.5.6.</note> except we our ſelves doe it, by reflecting, our owne ſhine and beames upon our ſelves. No doubtleſſe: we ſhall loſe more in the Hundred then we gain in the Shire, and left our worth to be valued by others.<note place="margin">A baſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb.</note> There is a baſe Proverbs, Thou ſhalt bee ſo much eſteemed by others, as thou eſteemeſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45715:50"/> thy ſelfe. But it holds onely in the Divels dominion. As for God (who reſiſts the proud, but gives grace to the humble) the weapons of his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare are not carnall,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.5.</note> but ſpirituall, caſting downe ſtrong holds, and all high thoughts to the obedience of Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.4.</note> and moſt of all in our ſelves, who are his Standard-bearers. But I muſt recall my ſelfe from this negative digreſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Why Eliſha comes not forth to Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note>Well then, if it were not pride and ſtatelineſſe in the Prophet, what cauſe was there why he ſhould ſend to <hi>Naaman,</hi> rather then come forth himſelfe? Was he not expected? and, might he not feare ſome aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his perſon, God, and Religion, by his aloofneſſe? Surely, by the way, theſe things ought much to curb our baſe paſſions! Biſhop <hi>Hooper,</hi> that famous Martyr of Chriſt, and man of tender conſcience, being of ſomwhat a more retired &amp; private ſpirit and carriage then uſual, did cauſe ſome Chriſtian men and women, who honoured his integrity, and ſought advice from him: to wonder, and to ſtumble at his auſterity. A defect which he could not eaſily amend in himſelfe. But it coſt him ſorrow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, as ſome of his letters witneſſe, that he ſhould grieve any good heart by ſuch an offenſive carriage. Thoſe letters are alſo extant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in reverend <hi>Ridley</hi> craves pardon of his deere fellow-Martyrs <hi>Bradford</hi> and <hi>Sanders</hi> for his unbrotherlike paſſages in ſome caſes: a time there will be, in which every one that feares God, will mourne for the leaſt miſdemeanor in this kinde. Gods glory is pretious, and his peoples ſouls coſt deare. They muſt not be offended for our humours, or trifles: bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a mill-ſtone were hang'd about our neckes, and wee caſt with it into the ſea, then to offend one little one. This by the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Miniſters muſt be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Gods glory, and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of offence by their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note>I anſwer, there had been in this caſe of <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſome feare of this, I mean of offence, if God had not diſcharged him from it by a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> to his ordinary charge: but having a warrant for it, hee might truſt God the better for preventing of hurt. As the Prophets were extraordinary perſons, ſo the moſt of their actions bare a ſpeciall reference towards God, not themſelves: And, ſo it was here: <hi>Eliſha</hi> was a man familiar e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in his owne caſe, as appeares in his homely and courteous carriage towards the woman that ſet him up a Table,<note place="margin">2 Kin. 4.12.13.</note> Stoole and Candleſticke in his Chamber. This was no great ſtate (nothing neere <hi>Naamans</hi>) yet thankfully accepted. But there is a ſeaſon for all things: to bee familiar with a poore Tradeſman,<note place="margin">Eccle. 2.3.2.</note> and to be ſtrange to a Prince, both lawfull. Now the Lords worke was in doing, and <hi>Eliſha</hi> might not procure to himſelfe the note of courteſie, by breaking a command; as that Prophet (who to avoid diſcourteſie) went backe to eate with the old Prophet,<note place="margin">1 King. 13.19.</note> and loſt his life.

The Lord loved <hi>Eliſha</hi> well, and his reputation, as we ſee Cap. 2. yet not ſo well as to part with his own,<note place="margin">2 King. 2.5.6. Eſay 42.5.6.</note> for his ſake. If God had intended only a bodily cure, it had been enough to have come out and laid on hand upon the leproſie, and ſo, an end. But the Lord who had a further ſcope, even to acquaint <hi>Naaman</hi> with himſelfe,<note place="margin">2.

Tne Lord ſtrives with his ſpirit, as Gen. 6.2. to drive out of it that ſame carnall ſavour, hope &amp; content wherewith he had filled himſelf, having heard that the Prophet could heale him. As for ſpirituall cure he felt no diſeaſe, nor knew any remedy of it: But, the Lord meant it, and therefore meant that <hi>Naaman</hi> ſhould in the meane ſeaſon be ſecretly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it. As our saviour told <hi>Peter,</hi> what I doe now,<note place="margin">John 13.7.</note> thou knoweſt not, but hereafter thou ſhalt. The Lord therefore by this croſſing his hopes, doth deſire to let in a further light into his minde, then yet he had: That he might conſider, that he was not now come to an ordinary perſon; to heale his body: but to the Lord, and his Prophet, to worke a divine cure: here therefore, he muſt looke up to God, ſtand to his curteſie, adore his power, love, goodneſſe and mercy: here is no marquet for money to beare maſtery, all muſt come from meer goodneſſe: and that, not from a Prophet, but from the Lord working by him. Now therefore having to doe with him, let his carnall ſavour, and erroneous conceits ly by, let him empty himſelfe of a wordly heart, and get an heavenly, as having only to do with God and not man.</p>
               <p>The ground affords many ſweet meditations: I wil briefly touch upon two or three, and ſo proceed. Thie firſt is this, All the courſe which God takes in bringing home the ſoul to God is (in a word) but this one, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the carnality and unſavourineſſe of the heart,<note place="margin">Gods way in converting any is chiefly to ſubdue carnall ſavour.</note> and the blindneſſe and error of the minde, to the obedience of Chriſt. From firſt to laſt the Lord aimes at this, (if we marke it) through all the preparations of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling, whether by Law or Goſpel: which may appeare by this, that the iſſue of all the worke of calling is faith. And faith (we know) is the cheefe obedience of the heart to the word, both commanding and promiſing, and tries moſt of all, the ſubjection of the ſoule. Such then
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45715:51"/> as is the end, ſuch is the preparative: all the whole courſe of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in converting the ſoule, is to yoke downe and ſubject the heart to himſelfe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.4.</note> by caſting out all which is ſet up in it, againſt it as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes. All oppoſition, all rebellion, all enmity which is therein, whether before the meanes revealed,<note place="margin">Note well.</note> (as all naturall poiſon of heart (ſuch as <hi>Naaman</hi> here is full of, carnall ſavour of his cure, reſting to the prop of fleſh and the Prophets ability) or under the meanes themſelves revealed, muſt ſtoop to God; ſomewhat or other, terrors or promiſes, or both, muſt rid the ſoule of each high thought, ſtrong hold, and error which ſuffers not the Lord to enter. So is it here with <hi>Naaman:</hi> he comes full of carnall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence upon the arme of fleſh, and his owne rewards, hope of ſpeeding and going home an whole man; but the Lord intending to ſend him home a new man, croſſes him in his old, and ſtrives to ſubdue the ſavour of his fleſh to the ſavour of divine power.</p>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45715:51"/> and abſtaining from ſome evills, biting in ſome ill qualities, which dare not breake out. But judge your ſelves by the caſting downe of your ſtrong forts, and high thoughts, and ſtout hearts: one dram of this will ſecure you more of a ſafe eſtate, and hold out longer then a pound of the other. Try whether in all your other proceedings, &amp; ſeemings to grow in the houſe of God, your ſelves grow daily lowlier, meeker, brokenner: for all Gods gifts are ſeaſoned with humilitie: and negatives (in this kinde) are your ſureſt markes: not ſo much what you have got in knowledge, but what you have loſt of your owne. If yee prove this latter, the other will proſper alone: otherwiſe this will be a canker to fret out the marrow of the other. It is no hard thing for a man to judge what meat his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite ſtands to, or not. Obſerve your owne frame, after all your hearings, God will not judge yee by the helpes, meanes, or gifts yee have: but by what your ſelves are. If then your ſecret conſciences bear you witneſſe, that when all is done, yet a proud heart, a ſcornfull ſpirit, uncharitable, ſelfe-loving, ranke for it owne ends, reſting upon carnall proppes, angry, revenging, claſping to the creature (as <hi>Naaman</hi> here did) or the like, ſtill lurke in yee, and beare the ſway, when ye are put to it; in Gods feare doe not reſt till the Word have wrought a further worke in you, and caſt downe this kingdome in you. Seek for more working both by the terror and promiſe: For ſurely till this old kingdome be down (at leaſt ſubdued and tributary, as <hi>Sauls</hi> houſe under <hi>David, Edom</hi> and <hi>Moab</hi> to <hi>Salomon;</hi>) all your hearings cannot profit you. Tremble when yee meet with the old kingdome (you ſhall ſoone try your ſelves when occaſion of triall comes) and be well aſſured, that whom the Lord calls, them he ſubdues, and here he pulls up one prop, there another pillar of the old throne, here he ſubdues ignorance, there a falſe heart, there a carnall minde,<note place="margin">God ſubdues corruption in his by peece-meale.</note> the ſavour of the fleſh, the will of man, the pride, the ſtomacke, the wordly ends, till he have ruined the throne: And although a ſubtile profeſſor will cover all theſe with the mantle of Religion, yet ſtill the compariſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides, becauſe he wants an heart to be rid of it. But as for others, you may feele them with a glove: for even in the midſt of their devotions, giving thankes for meat, praying or hearing, their hearts are with their covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and luſts; and ſometimes they will be quarrelling and praying, tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the world, and ſaying grace with one breath. But ſo much of this branch.</p>
               <p>A ſecond is this,<note place="margin">The ſecond meditaion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ib this.</note> I have noted before in <hi>Naamans</hi> crouching at <hi>Eliſha</hi> his gate, how that diſeaſe of his abaſed him very farre to ſuch an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or as the Prophet was. Now we ſee he receives an affront from him, by him whom he ſo ſubmitted himſelfe unto, being ſo far from healing him at the firſt, that hee comes not out to ſalute him. And why? To teach him to ceaſe his crouching to the Prophet, and crouch to God another while.</p>
               <p>Some might ſay, alas poore man! he had ſorrow enough before! but <label type="milestone">

                  </label> in an outward croſſe, nor the power of it, to ſubdue the heart to God: it may handſome a man in his outſide to manward, and make him ſtoope to man, but it cannot doe it to God. Wherefore now the Lord puts a tongue into the word and Meſſage of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> whereby he comes a little further to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45715:52"/> conſider whom hee had directly to deale with, even the Lord himſelfe, who ſuffers not the cure to proceed, to the end that hee might looke better about him, and ſee into his baſe heart, which hindred it. And wee muſt conceive that although this wrought not preſently, yet the Lord being with it, it wrought ſomewhat at laſt. Let it briefly teach us (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) thus much,<note place="margin">Bodily croſſes can reach no further then bodily ends. Job 33.13.</note> no croſſe nor bodily ſtrait (of it ſelfe) can reach fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to a bodily end: There muſt bee a word added to the workes of God, before the heart will breake. The Lord muſt (as I noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) ſpeak once and twice, ere pride will be hidden and the ſoule hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in kinde, and then it ſtoopes. Well ſaid <hi>Habacuc, Cap.</hi> 2. I heard thy voice, and my lips quivered, my limbes trembled, and rottenneſſe entred into my bones, that I might have peace in the day of trouble. And <hi>Eſay, Cap.</hi> 28. asketh, whom ſhall I cauſe to underſtand, and whom ſhall I teach wiſedome?<note place="margin">Heb. 4.12.</note> even him that is weaned from the breſts, and who trembleth at my words.<note place="margin">The word and voice of God onely able to pierce the heart.</note> It is the voice of God which muſt pierce the heart till it tremble. The voices of ſicke mens repentance wanting a word, vaniſh. The reaſon is, becauſe the workes alone are a brute ſound, and have no tongue in them: The word is all, onely God hath bleſſed it, and therefore other meanes are unbleſt. The word muſt be the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Nay, many times under a croſſe alone, the heart waxeth more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and rebellious: or at leaſt wiſe it puts off God with confeſſions under the rack: or elſe it windes out it ſelfe, and counts it as a common accident befalling mortality: Its my hard lot (ſaith one, God helpe me) to be thus afflicted. Even as bleſſings alone bring none to feele love from God (of themſelves) being common things beſtowed upon all ſorts as it hits, ſo is it with croſſes. Nay, ſome blinde idiots imagine Popiſhly, that their portion here in trouble, and ſtraits, is a ſigne that they have their hell here, and ſhall not therefore have it hereafter. But however, ſure it is, let a man have never ſo much ſickeneſſe, poverty, reproach, feare of death upon him: none of theſe are bleſſed to ſearch out his pride, jollity, carnall eaſe, unſavorineſſe, Atheiſme, worldlineſſe, or the poyſon of old <hi>Adam:</hi> Theſe all may lurke and abide under a croſſe: a man may ſtill nouzell himſelfe in his ſenſuality, ſecurity, rotten peace, unbeleefe, and hope that he is in Gods favour. But when the word comes, that daſhes out all errours, and falſe conceits. Why ſo? becauſe it brings God into the ſoule (as the Arke into the campe) and cauſes the ſoule to behold herſelfe in the glaſſe of his perfection; the neerer it comes to God, the more it loathes it ſelfe.<note place="margin">Job 42.2.</note> I have now ſeene thee (ſaith <hi>Iob</hi>) therefore I abhorre my ſelfe in duſt and aſhes. Let it teach us never to reſt till the Lord hath turned us out of our common path, and brought us into a narrow way, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to deale with himſelfe. His word will preſent him unto us, as in a glaſſe wherein we may behold him in his excellent Attributes, his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Wiſedome, revenge of his enemies, a Judge of the wicked, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of the righteous. This ſight will coole our courage (as it did <hi>Naamans</hi> here) ſtop us in our headlong courſes, make our owne conceits and errours odious, teach us to wait upon God, till he ſhall hearken to us: till he ſhall humble, convince, and perſwade us. Doubtleſſe, when wee come cloſely to behold his face, and to feele his authoritie over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, how ſevere an avenger he is of all our pride, rebellion; and that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45715:52"/> he whom we have to deal with, beholds our inward man and all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption thereof: nothing is hidden to his eye, but all things are naked and manifeſt before him: then all our heat of ſpirit,<note place="margin">Heb 4.13.</note> confidence of our happy condition, diſdaine of others, pleaſing our ſelves in our carnall hopes, applauding our parts, our duties, performances, will vaniſh as a private mans lands and livelihoods vaniſh in a great Mappe of the world. Then our plumes quaile, and we ſay, depart from us O Lord ſinfull wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. In the ſight of this Sunne, all our darkeneſſe, and unrighteouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Luke 5.7.</note> become irkeſome, and all our corruption is ſwallowed up in this ſea of his perfection. So much for this.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt ſhort meditation from this ground is this,<note place="margin">The laſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</note> that as the Lord began before to humble <hi>Naaman</hi> in part, ſo he holds him ſtill cloſe to the worke of humiliation, and enlarges him not,<note place="margin">Proud nature of man quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgets hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milition.</note> till he had brought him to ſound humbling of ſoule. It ſhewes us what our nature is, in this behalfe. We are like to light Corke, which will floate aloft, and (except a man hold it under by ſtrong hand) will pearke up to the top. When we are downe and low, one would thinke it ſhould be a great worke to raiſe us up to any cheere againe. But no ſooner is the ſtone blown upon, by a little puffe of winde (although it have been ſteept in water a whole night) but it waxes dry againe preſently, as if never wetted. The hard and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heart of proud man can never ſufficiently be battered, and tamed; but it wil returne to her courſe againe inſtantly. And the truth is,<note place="margin">Theſe dayes eſpecially, and why?</note> the dayes we live in have a peculiar diſeaſe in this kinde, above former dayes: Gods wrath revenging our former contempt of his law and terrors of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and our dallying with them, and ſhaking them off, through a baſe heart, weary of trouble. To be abaſed and low when and while the Lord will have us ſo, for our own good and to think well of it, is a rare grace. We are a kin to <hi>Ionah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jona 3. and 4.</note> who was no ſooner out of the Whales belly but (contrary to vow and covenant) pearkes up again preſently, and quarrells with God; for converting Ninivee: and for his ſlaine gourd: and no wiſedome would charme his folly. So <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron 32.25.</note> after the like recovery of the plague, and promiſe of humble carriage, yet inſtantly bubbles up againe, upon the comming of the Embaſſadours. If this be done by the greene tree, what is to be looked for in the dry? What wonder then if <hi>Naaman</hi> may ſo ill be truſted with a cure at firſt, under hope of humbling afterward? No, the Lord will hold him while he hath him, and treads upon his heele ſtill with new affronts to keep him at that bay till hee have throughly caſt out his ſcurfe.<note place="margin">God makes cleare way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</note> It is the Lords courſe to doe his worke ſubſtantially and throughly: hee will not ſuſtaine any diſhonour in his owne, that he hath built them by halfes: As for hypocrites, they flye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are halfe feathered, and can doe him no diſcredit. Hence it is that the Lord hath been faine to prolong affliction and abaſement upon his ſervants: that others beholding them might ſuſpect themſelves. It might ſeeme elſe a ſuperfluous thing to adde water to the ſea: and ſo long croſſes to <hi>Iob,</hi> a man already truly humble, and fearing God. But,<note place="margin">Job 1.1. 1 Tim. 1.16.</note> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of Gods grace towards him, that it was for the example of more then himſelfe: ſo was <hi>Iobs</hi> humbling, a paterne for all men to behold their owne baſe heart in this kinde, and what an hidden depth of ſcurfe is in the chinkes and corners of it.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:45715:53"/>
               <p>Verily, in theſe dayes, he or ſhe may be as wonders and ſtrange ſights, who walk duly (in the ſenſe of paſt and preſent corruption) before God with humbleneſſe, and privitie to themſelves: As the ſive holds water while it is in the water,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and no longer; ſo doth our proud heart ſtoop while the yoke is upon us: But few ſubdue their hearts to this ſafe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanure daily.

Oh (ſhould wee ſay) who hath more cauſe to walke humbly before God every houre then I?

But, as for eſteeming of this number of ſeven, to have any more holineſſe in it, then other numbers, it is ridiculous and ſuperſtitious.

This number hath done them ſome pleaſure, for elſe they would (no doubt) have proceeded to ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore ſacraments as well as to ſeven. And ſeeing this number is more pretious to them then Gods two, it is ſtrange that they dip not the infant ſeven times inſtead of three, counting it more holy then the Trinity! we abhorre them, and all their ſuperſtitious fopperies, and myſteries, more fit for inchanters and ſorcerers to worke by, then ſuch as goe to worke on Gods name, by the power of a word, and ordinance.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">See Joaſh his reproofe, 2 King 13.19.</note>The holy Ghoſt tyes not himſelfe to this number (as oft as he uſes it) but uſeth all other numbers as occaſion offers it ſelfe indifferently. As for. <hi>Naaman</hi> here, of the number of ſeven ſerves to teach any thing, it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the depth of infection in his body (and much more in his ſpirit) which needed ſuch frequent waſhing one after another, and all too little. But as for any holineſſe in the number (as ſeven) otherwiſe then the charge of God exactly required, we put none at all, in it. We leave that ſuperſtitious holineſſe, to them, who turned religion it ſelfe into a maſſe of ſuperſtitious, judaicall, phariſaicall, heatheniſh, and ſorcerous vanities: The true ſucceſſors of Phariſees, (as our Saviour tells us) That they put Gods ſervice in waſhing, pots, and platters, diſhes and trenchers, and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other toyes, deſtroying ſubſtance for circumſtance: even ſo do theſe: They place religion in old ſlippers, ſhooes, bootes and buskins, rotten chips, rotten garments: in Crucifixes, Images, and ruſty reliques: and ſo in numbers: yea, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Phariſees would have the moſt holy ſacrifices, and Temple of God to borrow their holineſſe from the gold of the Temple,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.16.17.</note> and the altar of ſacrifice, ſo do theſe. Forſooth, the moſt holy Ordinance of preaching, prayer, ſacraments (if theſe Phariſees may bee beleeved) muſt be holy, becauſe offered upon their altar or ſuperaltar, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe made, ſaid, or done in, and upon their conſecrated Temples, Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, or Maſſe altars! Oh ye fooles! is the whether is the more holy! the gold or the Temple!

A ſeparation of place, we acknowledge, to be meet, and fit, common uſe, for Gods: but, for inherent holineſſe in it, we abhor, and renounce. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, let us cleave to naked Scripture, and not fancy to ourſelves a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> whereſoever we ſee an old man, in a mantle, nor a myſtery, where there is no ſuch matter; and, ſo leave the ſimplicity of truth, for a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of ſuperſtition.

The more we cleave to the ſacred, and pure truth of God, the more we ſhall abhorre all ſuch fooleries. Give me one ſacrament of Chriſts inſtitution, and let them take the ſeven: One prayer made in faith, and let them take their 7.

                  <note place="margin">The meſſage it ſelfe.</note>The meſſage it ſelfe followeth. <hi>Naaman</hi> looked to be cured by great <hi>Eliſha</hi> that worthy Prophet: but the remedy which God makes uſe of, is the waſhing of his fleſh in Jorden ſeventimes. A poore thing (one would thinke) to compaſſe ſuch a great effect. But ſo it is, commonly the Lord
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45715:54"/> effects thoſe things which are of greateſt conſequence, by poore and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meanes, ſuch as the world would thinke moſt unlikely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. Commonly I ſay, ſo it is: I ſay not alway. For ſometimes,<note place="margin">God uſeth to effect ſolemne things, by ſee ly means.</note> the Lord chuſeth great ones, and wiſe ones, and learned, and valourous, and experienced, and in great eſteem, to be his inſtruments: becauſe he will be knowne in his owne gifts, leſt they ſhould not be eſteemed: But when it is thus, commonly the Lord ſhewes as great power in making ſuch inſtruments great, being of themſelves before meane or deſpiſed: at leaſt he brings them low in their owne eyes, and makes them rare patternes of humbleneſſe, before he dare uſe them.<note place="margin">Eſters hiſt. cap. 2.3.7.8. &amp;c. 1 Sam. 16.12.13.14. 2 Cron. 34.35. &amp;c.</note>

Not by his greatneſſe, but by his extraordinary grace of melting and humbleneſſe.<note place="margin">If God uſe great ones, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he makes them great of mean ones, or mean of great ones.</note> And ſo many Preachers perhaps are uſed to doe God ſome glory: But if compariſon be made (not betweene them and other of meaner gifts, but betweene them and the effects of converſion) what is a baſe ſinfull man with all his complements to God? and put caſe that ſometime the Lord doe uſe ſome men of great eſteeme with ſome carnall perſons for their excellent parts, the better to winne their great ſtomackes to like of his truth: yet this commonly is but a generall preparative to their converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for the Lord will ſtrike the maine ſtroke afterward, rather by ſome other inſtrument of meaner worth. All the Scriptures doe with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent beare witneſſe hereof, both in doctrine and examples. Our Lord Jeſus his worke of ſalvation was the greateſt worke that ever was done in the world. And who was he that did it? I confeſſe in himſelfe,<note place="margin">Eſay 53. 1 Cor. 1.20.</note> the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God and the power of God: but in the eyes of the world moſt baſe, the ſtumbling-blocke of the Jew, and fooliſhneſſe to the Gentile. By a ſonne of a poore woman, not an Empreſſe one borne in a ſtable and a cratch, not in a Palace: one that had not an hole to hide himſelfe in: one that rode upon an Aſſe, and had a few ſilly men and women cry Hoſanna to him: who dyed as a malefactor upon a Croſſe, the moſt cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed death of all other: By him the Lord effects this great worke. Not that hee could not have uſed greater preparations, but ſo it pleaſed him even to make him the corner ſtone, whom the builders refuſed. So the Apoſtles were uſed to preach Chriſt in the world, to ſubdue and conquer it all to himſelf: who were they? No men of great breed, birth,<note place="margin">Luke 5.</note> training or learning, but poore Fiſher-men, utterly unlearned. So <hi>Paul,</hi> a poore creature in ſhew, a poore withered branch, a man that affected no quaint phraſe, no elocution, but was weak in ſpeech,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.</note> is uſed to do more then any of the reſt. See 1 Cor. 1. Yee know brethren, your calling, how that not many learned, noble, or rich, but the mean things of this world, hath the Lord choſen, What is a greater worke then converſion and calling? And who are greater and more pretious objects then the called? Who honour God more then ſuch as beare his image, and are partakers of his Divine Nature. Now if God ſhould chuſe great ones, and jolly, wiſe and politick ones to ſuch ends, he ſhould confute this point; but he uſeth the pooreſt (as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith) and moſt baſe off all of this world to bee

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> Reaſons of the point are many. Firſt the Lord delights in caſting down and treading under feet all the pride of fleſh, and conceit of man, in beeing inſtrumentall to his worke. So ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. Where is the Scribe? where is the Law interpreter? where is the wiſe? God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the great things of the world, by his owne ſeely things.

The weakneſſe of God is ſtronger then man: and the fooliſhneſſe of God is wiſer then man: and therefore by his weakneſſe and folly he delights to controll the ſtrength and wiſdome of man. Thoſe falſe Apoſtles gloried much in their parts, and ſpeech, and skill: But the Lord choſe poor <hi>Paul</hi> with his weakneſſe to do more good in the point of converſion, then all of them. They made a great boaſt to man ward, and who but they? But the Lord laught them to ſcorne and all their complements, as enemies to the grace of Chriſt: and they who could diſcerne, at length perceived all their ſcope to be the ſetting up that trinity, of Belly, Ambition, and Covetouſneſſe, Phil. 3.18. and, ſo beeing diſcovered, they vaniſht in the opinion of the Church as ſmoke.</p>

When great exploits bee done by ſuch as are brave and jolly fellowes, men wonder not, but ſay, Yea, he was a brave man indeed: It troubles our baſe eyes to looke beyond that which is next us, and to ſee God in ſuch effects. As ſilver anſweres all things in price, ſo ſtrength and parts anſweres all effects in efficacie and working, and ſo God is thruſt out of doores. As in a Market men lay downe money, and take ware, ſo in this Market of worldly wiſedome, men thinke to effect any thing if they bring powder and ſhot to the battery. The Lord therefore ſubſtitutes ſeely inſtruments in ſtead thereof, and when mighty effects follow, then is his might magnified.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond, though wee deny not but the Lord is chiefe,<note place="margin">The 2.</note> yet ſtill we look at meanes, and thinke God workes by them, and why ſhould wee not therefore embrace them?

               <p>Thirdly, if we goe a little further,<note place="margin">The 3.</note> and ſet God up in his place above the meanes, yet we take it for granted, he muſt not faile us: wee will tye him to over-rule, and work by the meanes: and thinke much if God ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us not accordingly.

Even ſo hath it been with us. No ſooner hath the Lord planted in any place a faithfull Miniſter, as a ſhining Light, and burning Candle, but the people have fallen to idolize him, to rejoyce in his out-ſide, to thinke themſelves ſafe and happy in enjoying ſuch Inſtruments: aſcribing all the effect of his labours to him, little acknowledging the finger of God, or the office which hee ſuſtaines; not honouring him for the worke ſake which hee ſerves for, to reconcile them to God, to beget them to a lively hope by the Goſpell. This baſeneſſe of our fleſhly reſpects, hath cauſed the Lord to rob us of them, and to ſet mean ones in their roomes: To
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45715:56"/> teach men to lay to heart their former carnall ends. How many have received Prophets to farre other ends then the Lord ever ſent them? To make them as tearmes of compariſon between perſon and perſon, ſome to hold upon <hi>Apollo,</hi>

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have ſecurely reſted in their labours, never looking for any change of heart thereby, but thinking the Prophets ſhall live for ever: and when they are gone, fretting at their preciſeneſſe of conſcience, and unthankfully leaving them to ſink or ſwim, and ſhift as they can. Is this (beloved) to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God in his ordinance? to cleave cloſe to it, as (under God) the mean of converſion? Is this to count their feet beautifull, and to adore the Lord in the varietie of his gifts and inſtruments?<note place="margin">Rom. 10.15.</note> No, no: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord hath been fain to take them out of the way, and leave us to our ſelves: ſo that our ſupply was never ſo great as our defeat is ſtrange. All to teach us to looke at the ſimplicitie of Gods ends, to ſerve God firſt, and man with his leavings: let the Lord have the heart: ſet him up there, in ſelfe-deniall, humility, faith, ſincerity and faithfulneſſe: and then let the inſtrument have the over-plus, that honour and countenance which belongs to him for his ſervice.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No.</note> To which I anſwer: No. The Church of God hath alway joyned the porch of the Schoole to the Church, and drawne thence into her ſervice men ſufficiently qualified for all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and parts meet for the Miniſtery. When the Maſter leads the hand of a Boy to write, the leſſe the Boy moves of himſelfe, the meeter he is to grace the skill of the leader. But if any ſhould inferre hereupon, that the Boy were better want an hand altogether; who would not ſay, this were a ridiculous conſequence? It muſt bee preſuppoſed, that hee who is not qualified with gifts to teach, is no organ or hand at all for the Lord to make uſe of. <hi>Amos</hi> was an Heard-man, and in that reſpect meane enough: yet withall exceedingly qualified by extraordinary inſpiration: ſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles unlearned, and men of trade, howbeit very admirably gifted for the Miniſtery. Otherwiſe they had been no inſtruments of any honour to God at all, but rather of great reproach, as if God ſhould appoint men for the greateſt uſes, and not be able to qualifie them with gifts conducing thereto. Even ſo now, Arts and Studies are come in the ſtead of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary inſpirings: If men ſhould want the furniture thereof, how ſhould they interpret the Scriptures, order their ſpeech, utter their minde, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the hearer? The grace of the Spirit runnes in theſe as in a ſtream. But my meaning is, that men of like infirmities with others, mean perhaps for breed, for other carnall endowments, policie, greatneſſe in the world, yet the Lord having qualified them with abilities of wiſedome, grace, and poverty of ſpirit, uſeth them (as mean as they are) to his owne greateſt ends, converſion, I meane, and edification of ſoules. Though in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45715:57"/> other outward reſpects they promiſe little, yet the Lord workes great matters by them: Or if they have other complements of authority in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, awfulneſſe, experience and wiſedome in the world; yet being humble alſo, and abhorring pride, ſtate and jollitie (as all Gods Miniſters ought to do) they are mean in the eye of the world (whatſoever inward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies they have) for the world eſteems them ſo much, as they eſteem themſelves by the greatneſſe of their ſtomacke. Now it is not their skill &amp; knowledge which can hinder their humbleneſſe in their own eyes: no more then ignorance can cauſe humilitie. Nay, I dare ſay,<note place="margin">Gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doe no more cauſe pride, then ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth humility.</note> that if the number of proud ones were ſurveyed, we ſhall finde more of them proud through ignorance, and for lack of a bottome, then of their knowledge: though neither (without ſpeciall grace) can be humble. As then I would have none miſtake me in this point, ſo by the way, I would admoniſh all bold, ignorant and raw novices, and young Miniſters (of whom the world is full) who no ſooner are crept out of the ſhell, but thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fit enough for the Miniſtery (being yet wholly untrain'd in the way thereof, and very prone to fall into the condemnation of the Divell:) I doe admoniſh all ſuch to looke to themſelves: and beware leſt through a pearking and ventrous ſpirit, and a deſire after their owne ends, gaine and living, they diſhonour God, bring his ordinances into contempt, and by their running and ſhifting from place to place for meanes, they ſnare their conſciences ſo farre, that they can ſcarce get out againe when they would. Runnagate, idle, unlearned Curates and Hirelings, are a great bane to the Church. Let them wait the time, attend to reading, deny themſelves, learne of their betters and ancients (which few of them doe) and truſt God in due time for ſervice and reſpect in the Church.</p>

How hath the Lord then wrought in us? have we after a long ſleepy, and drowſie hearing and receiving, at laſt been pulld by the eare, and jogged by the Spirit, to ſtand up, and be awakened, to ſee the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders hidden under the veile of humane infirmitie, and the povertie of the Ordinances. Doe we wax wearie of formall remembring of a few ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, or commending the Preacher, talking of what we heard; and doe our hearts begin to burne within us when the Word is opened through the evidence of that Spirit which ſpeakes in the Word?<note place="margin">Luke 24.</note> Doe we feel the weight of truth uttered by a weake man, to bring our ſoules under the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of God, even as if hee himſelfe ſpake? Doe wee feele the power of an Ordinance (as farre above man, as heaven is above earth) to awe and over-rule us? It is a ſigne that God is preparing to worke ſomewhat more then ordinary in us, if we ſuffer it not to ſlip from us.</p>

Or how ſhould wee endure either to heare his voyce, or the voyce of an Angell? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the familiaritie of the inſtrument, and the weakneſſe of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, is a great benefit unto our ſimpleneſſe. And as thoſe Iſraelites were not able to beare the terrors of God, no nor ſo much as the face of <hi>Moſes</hi> (being armed and honoured with the extraordinary gifts of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) were faine to deſire that <hi>Moſes</hi> might ſpeake,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> and that with a veyle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his face, to weaken the ſhining of his countenance: So ſhould wee turne our offence at the baſeneſſe of Chriſt, and the ordinances, into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and thankes, that thereby, the excellency of God might bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated the more eaſily to our weakneſſe.</p>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45715:61"/> ſlight them ever the more. Rather, when our ſoules tremble at ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and boldneſſe of man, (that they ſhould dare with unskilfull or impure ſpirits, to obtrude themſelves upon Gods holy matters) and looke up to God by prayer, that either he would better and change, or elſe caſt them out of his Church; that they may no longer darken and deſtroy the excellencie of truth, by their ſacriledge and audaciouſneſſe. Mean time, looking beyond the ſin of the perſon, let us behold the glory of that Ordinance in the nature thereof, which yet wee ſee ſo ſullied and eclipſed by the blindneſſe and wickedneſſe of baſe uſurpers.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">7 Mark.</note> when wee can faſten upon thoſe great things which the Lord offers us by weake meanes, and that by faith in a promiſe; taking them out as our owne peculiar portion. For, as when the Lord caſt downe the walls of Jerico by thoſe Rams-hornes, the chiefe active inſtrument of the miracle, was, the faith of the Church,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> as the Author of the Hebrewes tells us; ſo, the great things of God are conveyed by faith into the heart, through the Conduit of a promiſe. Looke what the Lord of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Sabbath, and Sacraments, hath promiſed to work by them in the ſoule, (when there ſeemes leaſt likelihood to man) that the ſoule may and will expect from him thereby through faith.</p>
               <p>Therefore try our ſelves in ſome of theſe. This doctrine aimes not at diſcourſing of the ſeverall workes of the Word; yet ſo farre as the point will admit, let us try our ſelves by ſome of them. The promiſe of God aſſures us, that the weapons of the Miniſter of God, are mightie, through God, to caſt downe ſtrong Towers of a prejudicate, rebellious, ſtout proud heart, and the high thoughts of man,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.4.</note> which reſiſts the obedience of Chriſt: Can we then ſpeake it in truth, that we have found this vertue go out from the Word into us, that when wee went to the Word full of our ſelves, yet we have returned thence emptie? And as a Souldier out of an hot battell, wherein he hath loſt an hand, a legge, or received ſome dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wound; yea, (which is more) loſt his great ſtomacke, ſo that hee ſees himſelfe to be a very foole, and no body to that he ſeemed: So, have wee ſeen that in the Law which hath cooled our courage, and made us affraid to ſet up our briſtles any more? Then a weak Ordinance hath wrought a ſtrong worke in us; for it hath maſtered that which was our ſtrong fort, I meane the fervour of our jolly ſtomacks. It was not the work of a poore inſtrument, but the power of God which did it.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is the promiſe of God that the truth ſhall make us free? Have we then felt that it hath unbound our ſoules from the chaines of our feare, bondage and infidelitie? Hath it ſo enlightned us with the glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Chriſt, that it hath alſo piercied into our affections deeply, to long and hunger after them for our ſelves? Did we finde, that after once we heard the truth as it is in Jeſus, wee could not lin, nor give over till it conveyed the merit of his ſatisfaction and bloud into us, to pacifie our conſcience, and to rid us of that feare of death,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.15.</note> whereunto before wee were ſubject? And ſo renew our ſoules by the efficacie of his death, ſo that we have crucified our old man with the affections and luſts:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.18.</note> and felt the bloud, ſtrength and marrow of the new <hi>Adam</hi> and quickning Spirit reviving our veines and bones? Surely then poore meanes have done great things in us, far above all which the power of weake man can reach
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45715:62"/> unto. Againe, the Goſpell ſerves to breed and beget the ſoule to the hope of immortality and life in us. Doe wee then feele, that as poore as the Preacher was,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.</note> yet the Lord over-ruled him ſo, as by the power of the Spirit breathing in him, the carnall ſavour of the creature, the love of the world, and a fading life here below, is driven out of us, and the breath and ſavour of Grace and Heaven is put into us? Hath it caſt out our lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring after an earthly Paradiſe, irrecoverable, and carried us into a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of glory, never to be caſt out more? Hath it filled us with heavenly deſires, even while we are upon earth? Hath it ſet us in an eſtate of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and peace? yea, as it were in a rich veine of hope, wherein wee are reſtleſſe, and ever digging deeper, till we attaine full ſatisfaction in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the fountaine? Surely, if we can ſay this, in any meaſure, we may buy and ſell upon it, that the promiſe by faith hath been the mean of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us, baſe fleſh, and ſinfull duſt and aſhes, to the Lord himſelfe, eternall and incomprehenſible: that is to ſay, corrupt, weake, wretched man, to God, bleſſed for ever. Nothing can doe ſuch a worke but a divine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by the power of a Mediator through a promiſe: for what is weaker then a Miniſter to effect it, or what more impoſſible and incompatible, in reaſon, then for a ſinfull man to partake it? This then bee ſaid of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing collected out of this verſe, to wit, the meanes of <hi>Naaman</hi> his healing, the waſhing in Jorden.</p>

For it may bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, ſeeing that, not the waters themſelves were the cauſe of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this cure upon <hi>Naaman,</hi> but the power of God onely in and by them. To what end did the Prophet ſo preſſe upon him the waſhing in Jorden? and why had it been ſo heynous a contempt for him to have neglected this charge?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why God u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth outward means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey grace: viz. To ſtop mans devices.</note> The anſwer is double: Firſt, in reſpect of the neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the water to the inſtrumentalnes of Gods working: Secondly, in reſpect of a ſigne or ratification of the promiſe in the heart of <hi>Naaman.</hi> To open both theſe in a word: For the former, it is alway the courſe of God to worke by meanes and inſtruments, ſenſible and bodily; when hee hath to doe with us, men of a bodily and ſenſible nature. As in the duty of prayer, though the worke thereof is properly ſpirituall and holy, and the Lord can tell our hearts, as well as our tongues; yet it is his will that we offer it up by the inſtrument of outward ſpeech, orderly ſet &amp; ſenſible: Take unto you words &amp; ſay,<note place="margin">Hoſea 13.2.</note> receive us graciouſly. So, though the power of regeneration ſtand not in ſpeech, but in the Holy Ghoſt: yet the Lord will not ſo worke immediately, but by the miniſtery of man to man, hee hath ordained to convey his ſpirit into the heart. And the reaſon is plain: for elſe what a door ſhould be ſet open to the fantaſticall ſpirit of man, to vent his owne ſpeculations and conceits, without any warrant from God? Who would not frame to himſelfe revelations of the Spirit, and deviſe new inventions of ſerving God? How doe Anabaptiſts boaſt of their owne fancies? How doe they deſpiſe the ordinary calling of Miniſters and preaching, and thruſt forth themſelves by the inſtinct of their owne ſpirit, as if they were ſome great perſons? How do Papiſts deviſe new worſhips, as that Maſſe of theirs (which is nothing elſe ſave a maſſe of many ingredients added by ſundry of their Popes, or maſters of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies)
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45715:62"/> and thoſe many Sacraments of theirs, whereof not one print of Gods appointing appeares in all the Scriptures? If this be done by them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the expreſſe will of God, what would they have attempted, if they had been left unto themſelves? How infinite would they then have been? Therfore the Lord wil have all that look for any worke of his Spirit, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the means cloſely, and reverently, and only by &amp; through them to expect for bleſſing. If God pleaſe to unite his grace only to them (ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily) may it not well beſeeme us to tye our attendance and obſervation of his power in and by them? This is one cauſe why the Lord would not extraordinarily convey himſelfe to the Eunuch, to <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 8. Acts 10. Acts 9.</note> to <hi>Saul</hi> at Damaſcus, ſave by the intermediall inſtruments of <hi>Peter, Philip,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias;</hi> our ſpirit is alway in our extremities: for either wee runne to our fancies, conceits, ſloath and eaſe, contemning the meanes, or elſe (when meanes muſt be uſed) we fall to idolize them; both which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt abhorres.</p>

Thus when the Lord meant to rend tenne Tribes from <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and give them to <hi>Ieroboam,</hi>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45715:63"/> falſe Prophets <hi>Zidkijah</hi> and <hi>Hananiah,</hi> affected the like courſe in their hornes and yokes. Even ſo, the Lord did teach his people by many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ceremonies, cleanſing of leproſie by the Prieſt, and, waſhing by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſacrifices, and the like. And by thoſe many reſemblances of the blood of the Paſchall Lamb ſprinkled, and the fleſh of it eaten: as alſo by Manna, the Rocke guſhing forth with water: Alſo by the cutting off the foreskin of the male, he made the Lord Jeſus and the power of his death and croſſe to bee knowne ſacramentally, (although but darkly) in his Church. And now under the New Teſtament, although the worſhip be more ſpirituall,<note place="margin">Sacraments excell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſignes.</note> yet the courſe is the ſame. True it is, Sacraments ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſignes in their efficacy, yet agree with them in this generall kinde of outward ſignifying or ſtrengthning the ſoule by ſignes. For what elſe doth the Lord by Baptiſme, or the Supper, but ratifie the weake receiver, in reſpect of the faith of the Covenant?</p>
               <p>Let us therefore make uſe of this holy courſe of God for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and aſſurance: and as ſeales exceed bare covenants, becauſe they carry the parties to an aſſurance of faithfulneſſe betweene them, through the ſtrength of the Law of the land in that caſe made and provided, that they may not ſtagger or queſtion the meaning of each other: ſo, let us thankfully embrace the courſe of God toward us for our eſtabliſhment in his purpoſe and covenant, both to ingraft us into himſelfe, and nouriſh us in himſelf, as the branch in the ſtock. Let us not cavil at the difference of miraculous and ordinary ſignes: for the Author of the one, is author of the other, and (in meaſure beſt known to himſelfe) hath promiſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with the one as well as the other: yea, the miraculous herein, comes ſhort of the ordinary, in that the former had but a temporary aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for the preſent occaſion; whereas the ordinarie have promiſe of a more ſpirituall and excellent aſſiſtance untill the end of the world: let us not then requite the Lord baſely for this his proviſion: let us not become weaker thereby, as weake children in their limbs, when they are taught to ſtay themſelves by a raile or frame for the nonce, grow weaker after ſuch proviſion then before. Whereas rather we ſhould uſe ſuch helps as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinde eyes, and weake limbs uſe: that as Spectacles and Crutches, both to preſerve and relieve their ſight and goings. We ſhould ſtruggle againſt our carnall diſtruſt, by theſe ſenſible ſtayes, and ſay: As verily as I have been waſht in the Jorden of Baptiſme, ſo verily ſhall the fleſh of my ſoul come again, as the fleſh of a little child, I ſhall be clean, and I lot upon it by faith.

And it containeth in it the anſwer of <hi>Naaman</hi> to the Prophets meſſage: For the handling whereof I will firſt lay down the method of the anſwer in theſe two verſes, and ſo come (God willing) to the ſeverall points therein, as they lye in their order.

Surely very ill, and unwelcomly.<note place="margin">Three ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls in this verſe.</note> This ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall containes three ſpecialls: The firſt (not in words, but in ſenſe) is the ground of this diſtaſte, which he doth not conceale; he is too full, and this is the third affront he had met with in his journey: For firſt,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Naamans</hi> ſelfe-conceit and prejudice.</note> hee goes the wrong way to the King of Iſrael, and loſes that labour. Secondly, when he is ſet in his way, lo, hee comes to the Prophets houſe and crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; but the Prophet comes not at him. Thirdly, that might have been borne, if the errand had bene thereafter; but now that alſo ſavours of dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying and delay, and now he utters all, and ſaith; Behold, I thought with my ſelfe, he would come out and lay on his hand and heale me; but lo, he ſends me word I muſt goe to Jorden. Surely, this is but mockery, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thinke he meanes me good: Thus he utters himſelfe.<note place="margin">The opening of it.</note> The root then of his diſcontent, is his conceit or ſelfe-prejudice, he would frame a way of cure to himſelfe, without any warrant from God or the Prophet; to wit, that now (ſure) the worke would ſoon be done, <hi>Eliſha</hi> would lay on his hand upon the diſeaſe, and in Gods name heale it without any more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe. Now he ſees it falls out otherwiſe, hee is at a ſet, and knowes not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45715:64"/> what to make of it: If hee had moderated himſelfe in his heate of ſelfe-thoughts, and ſaid thus within himſelfe; Surely, it is God that I have to doe withall, and how hee will goe to worke with me, I know not: I may imagine a thing, but he in whoſe power the ſtroke is, muſt determine, and good reaſon that I follow, and be led by him; and well I may, for I ſhall be a gainer at the laſt; and what is it for me to wait, in reſpect of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good I ſhall enjoy? If this had been his thought, how well and equally had his heart been carried through the worke? But lo, ſelfe-opinion ſets ſuch a colour before his eye, that hee is wholly tranſported with it out of his owne poſſeſſion, and now being croſſed of his own plot and way of healing, he is out of patience. This is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond ſpeciall: The fruit of this conceit. Diſcontent and rage.</note>The ſecond is the fruit of this defeat, and that is wrath, and going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in a rage: both teſtimonies of ſelfe-defeated: Firſt at the meſſage hearing he is wroth, and when he had vented the cauſe, then (as a man ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering more and more ſtomacke) he addes this, viz. an abandoning and renouncing of the Prophet, and turnes away in a rage; yea, reſolves to give him over (as full of him as hee was before) and to goe home as hee came, let all goe which way it will, hee will loſe all his labour, rather then be thus gulled and mocked by any man. A ſtrange thing that this ſtuffe ſhould appeare in him, who had ſo farre put himſelfe upon the Prophet.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The third ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall: His ſtrengthening himſelfe in his humour, by carnal reaſon, in Verſe 12.</note>The third thing is the backing and hardning himſelf in this his diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (for all wrathfull ones love to ſeeme mad with reaſon, leſt it ſhould appeare that want of reaſon made them ſo) and his colour is to confute the Prophets meſſage. The ſumme is, the Prophet hath ſent for me to make a gull of me, pretending to heal me when he intends nothing leſſe: For if he did, to what end ſhould he preſcribe me to waſh in Jorden? If waſhing there would ſerve, how comes it to paſſe, that there bee ſo many Lepers in Iſrael unhealed? And if ſo be, Jorden be ſuch ſoveraigne wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what are our rivers at home, Abana and Pharfar, which yet never were knowne to be medicinable for the leproſie? What a meſſage then is this to ſend me, Waſh in Jorden and be clean? Lo (I beſeech you) to what a man may come who is blind-folded with ſelfe! He will ſtiffen himſelf in his error by any argument comming next hand: Carnal reaſon then here offers it ſelfe to confute the meſſage, as a mockery. And how (I pray) doth it argue? Thus, Its a ſenſleſſe, unlikely thing, nay impoſſible to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. What then? haſt thou forgot thy ſelfe <hi>Naaman?</hi> Cameſt thou to be healed by reaſon, or by a Prophet? What a conſequence is this? Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reaſon judgeth otherwiſe, therefore it is ridiculous that Jorden ſhould heale. Nay rather, if a Prophet from God will heale by Jorden, why may he not? For he heales not by Jorden, as Jorden, but as by an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods divine power. Therefore rather to argue againſt God by carnall reaſon, is more ridiculous. Thus much for the opening of theſe two verſes.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The firſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, viz. Why God delayed the cure ſtill? That he might know himſelf.</note>I will firſt give a briefe touch of the triall which God put here upon <hi>Naaman,</hi> in delaying his cure. Why was it? To try all which was in his heart, and to make him ſee what metall he was made of: God was loath to ſend him away with his cure, and a proud wrathfull heart withall. Therefore now he diſcovers him to himſelfe, and rather by this delay of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45715:64"/> the miracle, chuſes to make all his crouching and humbleneſſe, breake out into rage and diſtemper, &amp; bewray him openly, then he ſhould nuzzle up himſelfe in a faire opinion of that which is not in him. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſtion. </seg>
                  </label> But it wil bee demanded, Did <hi>Naaman</hi> feele the Lord preſent in this worke? Did hee not as a carnal man in all this? or is it any wonder he ſhould be a wrathful raging man, being a Heathen, and croſſed in his maine aime? I anſwer: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> We muſt not ſo much conceive him as he is in his owne ſenſe, as in Gods ſhaping him to his own end, by grace and converſion.<note place="margin">Naaman to be conceived of as one under Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip.</note> When once <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> truly came to himſelfe, both the former rubs, and this affront of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying his healing, wrought a marvellous abaſement in his ſoule, and ſet forward the worke exceedingly. I have already handled the reaſon why the Lord ſtopt <hi>Eliſha</hi> from comming out: Now I would briefly adde this, how God tries him in diſappointing his haſte, and thereby occaſions him to rebell and break out, that he might know himſelfe yet more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly. And let it teach us this, That the cuſtome of God is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Whom God will ſave, he will teach them to to know all in their heart.</note> when hee is working any great change in any, hee will try them deeply, and make them know what is in their ſpirits: They ſhall finde many a ſtop in their courſe, things ſhall not ſucceed as they deſire: God wil hide himſelf from them, and ſeeme not to regard their labours, prayers, teares, endevours, but ſuſpend their hopes and deſires from ſuch ſucceſſe as they look for. And why? To try them, of what frame they are, whether their forwardneſſe <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> and zeale bee well planted in them, or no: whether they will wait, or make haſte, attend meekly, or run headlong. If they fall to diſtemper and wearineſſe, God will ſhew it unto them, that they may afterward watch and have themſelves in a deep jealouſie, and not bee deceived with the appearance of grace in ſtead of ſubſtance. If they ſtick to the triall, and carry themſelves meekly and quietly under Gods delayes and prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his time, that then they may acknowledge by what ſtrength they ſtand. However, it is very fit they ſhould be tried.</p>
               <p>Thus the Text ſaith, Deut. 8.2.<note place="margin">Deut. 8.2.</note> that the Lord dealt with the Iſraelites in the Wilderneſſe. Firſt, hee would not lead them the right way, by the land of the Philiſtims: but by the Wilderneſſe: and there hee would ſo hold them occupied, that whereas they might have been there in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes, he led them a traverſe of fourty yeares. Hee held them to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat, and when he gave them a ſupply, yet hee gave them but from hand to mouth: and why was all this? <hi>Moſes</hi> tells them; even to try all that was in their heart, to turne it up-ſide-downe, that by all the weary jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of the Deſert, their hunger, their wants, Gods proviſion, their unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, Gods judgements, waſting them, delaying and croſſing their lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring after Canaan, a land flowing with milk and hony, by the ruine of all the carcaſſes of them that came out of Egypt, the Lord might cauſe them to know themſelves &amp; the Lord thorowly, deny themſelves, wait upon his promiſe, and enjoy Canaan with a more humble and thankfull heart, then elſe they had done. Otherwiſe what boot had it been to have brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into Canaan with their fathers ſpirits? The land certainly had ſurfeted them, and vomited them out elſe, as ſoone as they had come in: but now <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> experience of the Wilderneſſe, taught them how to walke before God.<note place="margin">God begins with his people as he means to proceed.</note> The Lord begins with his owne as hee means to proceed: Hee meanes to make them patient, meek, enemies to ſelfe, privie to more corruption then
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45715:65"/> the world knowes of, jealous and watchfull, and willing to be as God will have them, and to thinke it beſt to be baſe, when God ſees it meet: this I ſay the Lord is faine to deale with his betimes, even in the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of his grace, (as a man would bow a twig as he would have it grow after:) And therefore in the very threſhold he ſtops their haſty courſe, and whereas they would thinke they might be converted and beleeve quickly, aſoone as they feele their need and heare of a promiſe, lo, the Lord makes it a longer worke then ſo, and delayes them, till he have laid a foundation for after times, till he have made them know all that is in their heart, and not think much of Gods corrections afterward, as having been traind up to the yoke from their youth. <hi>Ephraim</hi> was as an heifer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed to the yoke,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.31.</note> but when ſhe was yoked and humbled, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to God, and ſmote upon her thigh, and ſo was fitter for mercy, then when ſhe was wild and unbroken.</p>

But, when we ſee how the Lord croſſeth us, what blocks are in our way, and how hard it is to be veſſels prepared for mercy, to be clenſed from our evill ſavour, which would defile the grace of God, then we wonder that ever the Lord ſhould beſtow any mercy upon us at all. And ſo, we walke in the ſenſe and ſavour of it more humbly and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully afterward: we ſuſpect our baſe hearts, we are jealous of forgoing it, earneſt to purſue it, glad of the leaſt dram of it, and why? we know the price and worth of it,<note place="margin">In this frailty and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature, we can beare no great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of grace.</note> by good experience of that it coſt us to compaſſe it. Where is there a man who is meet to enjoy any great matter from God, either outward bleſſing, or ſpirituall favour, without pride and ſwelling? So that the Lord is faint alway to be much in preparing ſuch as he intends to beſtow any great matter upon. How long was <hi>David</hi> in preparing by the Lord,<note place="margin">See 1 Sam. from chap. 15. to the end of the book.</note> ere he came to the kingdome? Between his firſt anointing, and his Crowning, how many turn againes and purſuits had he? Surely as the Merchant of the Eaſt Indies who ventures for rich wares and pretious commodities hath an hard taske of it, goes through ſtrange hazards, by pirates, by tempeſts, by winds, by rocks, and by continuall feare, both go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, and comming home with them: and all to teach him the price of them, that he may after enjoy them more ſoberly; ſo is it here. The Lord is faine to prolong the day of his mercy and pardon, and to bring the ſoul through many adventures, to teach it to enjoy mercy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wantonneſſe, giddineſſe, lightneſſe, and boaſting. A drunken man can beare ſtrong drinke or wine with his weake braine, aſwell as our ſlight hearts can entertaine grace: we wax vaine, and frothy, idle and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty, as not knowing what we have received from God, nor how ſober and wiſe we ought to be in the uſe of it.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.2.3.</note> So <hi>Paul:</hi> the Lord meant to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt him with deep revelations: But before that, how was he faine to buffet him? what bitter greetings had he of his vile heart, and how was he abaſed in his owne feeling? And why? Surely to teach him to walke
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45715:65"/> humbly not to ſwell, nor diſdaine others, but to diſtinguiſh the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Gods grace from the baſeneſſe of his owne ſpirit.</p>
               <p>As we ſee it to fall out in the diſpoſition of ſeaſons and weather:<note place="margin">Simil.</note> while the winter ſeaſon is in her ſetling and height, although there be a generall coldneſſe of the aire; yet it is mixed with ſome calmneſſe, and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But when once the ſpring tide is approaching, we ſee what inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of weather there is, winds, raines, tempeſts, and bluſtering: all to purge the sky, and to bring down the winterly diſtempers of it, that the coaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cleare, the ſweet ſeaſon of the ſpring and ſummer may ſucceed. Juſt ſo it is with the ſoule: perhaps while it lies under the winter of her owne deſolation, ſhe makes a ſhift, and hath no great chaines upon her, as being under the hatches of miſery: But if once the Lord cauſe the ſpring time of life and converſion to approach; ſtrange it is, what tempeſts, clouds, and weather ariſe, the heart growes full of feares, corruption rebells, by occaſion of the Law, and ſelfe riſes up in armes by occaſion of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; a marvailous change appeares in the ſoule, through terrors, bondage, doubtings, reſiſtings, cavellings, and diſtempers of a baſe heart, loth to leave that hell of hers, (which by cuſtome became her heaven.)

For why? when hypocrites once come to ſee the conditions of grace, what attendance upon means, what knowledge and ſenſe of ſin, what deep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing of conſcience is required: how humble, hungry, painfull, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, the Lord lookes the ſoule ſhould be, that deſires grace, how plain-hearted in her aimes, and priſing it above all liberties, how willing to ſell all, (and glad it may) to buy this pearle: lo, their rotten carnall hearts fly off, and abhorre to ſtoop ſo low upon any hopes: They thought heaven might be compaſſed with ſmall adoe, and that they might have it, and their owne wills too: But when they ſee it will not be: nay more, that many a poore honeſt ſoule is faine to waite long at Gods gate, till he ſee it a fit ſeaſon to beſtow his grace upon it: alas! poore wretches! they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were either ſo pinched with ſinne, nor affected with mercy, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow halfe the coſt for it, although they might be ſure of it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fall off, either altogether, and ſo turne backe to their luſts; or elſe, if light and compulſion of conſcience ſcare them from that, they ſtill abide as they are in a ſapleſſe, fulſome, and dead courſe. But it is not ſo with the others. Gods true Merchants of the beſt pearles, who know the true worth of them, will not be beaten off by ſuch diſcouragements, but (but with <hi>Naaman</hi> in the verſes following) rather then they will forfet all their hopes, and carry back their lepers skin With them:<note place="margin">See Mat. 13.44.</note> they will put their lives in their hands, or rather themſelves in the Lords, to deale with them as he pleaſe, and whatſoever difficulties or delayes they meet with, they will beare them, ſeeing they are for the beſt, all ſhall end well: By waiting the Lord will appeare at laſt, but by giving him over, they are ſure to periſh. Oh! there is great uſe of this courſe! how many deſperate
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45715:66"/> hypocrites doth the Lord trie hereby, diſcovering their baſeneſſe, rage, and diſcontent? and how doth he comfort his owne faithfull poore ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that have waited upon his ſalvation, aſſuring them it was his owne grace that ſuſtained them in ſuch delayes and difficulties to hold on?</p>

Let not him that puts on his harnis, boaſt as he that puts them off. Rather make account of the hardeſt before and be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt it, be not diſcouraged nor faint in the onſet, for I tell thee the worſt of Gods way is eaſier then the beſt of thy former courſe of luſt and ignorance, the pathes whereof are pleaſant, yet going downe to hel. And being warned thus, it will be halfe an arming to thee, it will coole thy carnall heat, ſend thee to God for ſtrength, and make thee out of ſavor of thy ſelfe-attempts. Secondly, when thou ſhalt meet with ſuch hardneſſes in the way, wonder not nor ſhrinke backe: ſay thus, I entred upon regeneration with this proviſo, and laboured to caſt the hardeſt. If eaſier termes be offred by Gods providence, if Satan be kept off, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, held under, or the work made ſweeter then I feared, let me count it my gain and a portion which many of my brethren want. But if I meet with brunts, let me not deſiſt and goe backe to Egypt, but proceed on towards Canaan, hoping that yet the iſſue ſhall be good. Say thus, now the Lord is trying of me, of what mettle I am made, even as he try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe ſouldiers that ſooped water,<note place="margin">Judg. 7.</note> or lapped it: now is the ſeaſon for me to looke about me, now let me abhorre to play the timeſerver, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, ſtaggerer, and revolter from Gods way, becauſe I meet with offences in it. If now I turne away and be diſtempered, vowing that I will never goe on one ſtep further, nor ſtrike one ſtroke more, I ſhall ſhew my ſelfe and the mettle I am made of, but if I ſhall meekely devour and digeſt theſe affronts, then I ſhall ſhew a patient wayting heart upon God, and one that eſteemes grace above all my labour, and a rich bargaine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the price. If <hi>Naaman</hi> had beene aware what God intended him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, hee had ſaid no leſſe: God tryes me by this delay, God make me meek, and keep me from rage!

               <p>Others feeling theſe wrought in them, yet when they heare that faith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> only can put them into a ſafe eſtate, they begin to feare that although they are prepared by the condition, yet the Lord will not performe the effect of faith for them (forgetting that Gods meaning in the one was to worke the other) or at leaſt thinke it will be a long time firſt, and they ſhall be out of all heart ere then, or they may dye ere the Lord make an end of his worke. Others conceive amiſſe of the promiſe, thinking it to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> be offred to ſuch as can take hold of it by themſelves: not knowing that the ſtrength is Gods and not theirs, Eſay 27.5.6. and that the offer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſtrength of a ſatisfaction to juſtice, doth ſtrengthen the Lord to make and tender it to a poore ſoule that needs it: and concurs with that ſoule ſtrongly to faſten it thereon, as the due portion belonging to it.

Others meet with diſcouragements from ſuch as ſhould encourage them; and ſo they fall the more ſadly upon them: When the Spouſe had dallyed with her beloved, through eaſe and carnalll tenderneſſe, ſecurity and ſelfe-love, lo, in following after him ſhe was met by the Watchmen,<note place="margin">Cant. 5.6.7.</note> who buffetted her; Theſe ſhould have encouraged her: Even Miniſters are oft great affronts in the way of poore ſoules, rating and ſcorning them for their ſingularity; eſpecially when they (through errour) light upon ſuch, as thinking better of them. So doe Parents, Guardians, Maſters, lay offences in the way of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, orphans, ſervants; ſome threatning to diſ-inherit them, or to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace them; others by their ſnibbing and chiding, or over-bearing them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> doe blaſt that bud which elſe would bloſſome and beare.

Oft-times the Lord tries ſome by company, pleaſure, liberty, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> occaſions of ſudden wrath, diſtemper, worldlineſſe: and infinite it were to mention all.

Thinke of theſe matters ere they come: let us not be ſo buſie with cockle ſhells and toyes upon the ſea ſide, that we forget the tide, and ſo be ſwept away all on the ſudden.

We are never tried by God,<note place="margin">Gods ends in triall, not like Satans.</note> but to ſift our Branne away from our Flowre, that his graces may be purer, and more pretious then Pearles. Satan indeed tempts, that hee might boult out all our Flowre, and leave nothing but Branne. Satan alſo tempts us, that he might leave us as he did <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> ſtript and bereft both of grace and peace, to an hardned, deſperate, impenitent ſpirit. But the Lord
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45715:69"/> tries us; that after he hath found us upright and faithfull he might ſet his marke upon us, of allowance; and that we might for ever walke in and out,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> both toward him with confidence, and within our ſelves with peace, paſſing underſtanding. Which peace, as we have procured by a good conſcience, ſo it is preſerved thereby: Therefore look not at the difficulty of a triall, but looke at the miſery which an ill conſcience, and the happineſſe and joy which a good will leave behinde it: ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as all the fulfilling of our luſts can never afford us? Can the ſon of <hi>Iſhai</hi> give ye vineyards?

Moreover pray dayly, not againſt trialls (for the triall of our faith and faithfulneſſe is more pretious then gold) both in reſpect of our ſelves who know not what our grace is,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.7.</note> till we be put to triall, nor yet what corruption lurkes in us, and therefore know not in what reſpects we ſhould either be thankfull, or humbled: and of God alſo, who is honoured much in the trialls of his, and when he purpoſeth moſt to honour them,<note place="margin">And pray that we be not led into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

And ſo much for this firſt point out of this eleventh verſe.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to the next point in this verſe, which is one of the maine points which I intended in the chooſing this Scripture (beloved) to treate of among you.<note place="margin">The maine point of this whole Text and Treatiſe.</note> And that is the cauſe it ſelfe directly of this diſtemper of <hi>Naaman,</hi> the unſeaſonable ſtop of the cure expected. And that was this, that he had a ſelfe-conceit of a way of curing him, (whereof yet he had no ground) which now he is croſſed of. He confeſſeth it himſelfe at large: marke his owne words, Behold (ſaith he) I thought with my ſelfe, that he would ſurely come forth and pray to his God, and ſtrike his hand upon the place, and heale the leper. But who told him ſo? had he any warrant for it? no, none ſave himſelfe. But now, ſo deadly doth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and toy of his owne braine worke with him, that being defeated, he is out of ſorts, and chuſeth rather (hearing of Gods way) to goe away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> Selfe is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy when all is done, which will bereave an unſound heart of grace.</note> then to be cured thereby: or by any way ſave his owne. The point which I commend unto you is this, when all is done, without eſpeciall prevention ſelf will defeat the ſoul of mercy. That is, although men are in a very forward likelihood of obtaining converſion, yet there may be ſome bitter root of ſelfe, which may thwart and bring it to ſmall effect. I mean not that ſuch a tech as <hi>Naaman</hi> took here, may do it: (for all are not as he, in point of ignorance of Gods way) but from this particular of ſelfe in him, (which was ſelfe-conceit and carnall eaſe) I gather a like concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all ſelfe whatſoever,<note place="margin">A further ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ground. Note.</note> (for ſelfe is a monſter of many heads, a ſtocke of many bowes and branches.) That ſelfe may marre all the faire endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45715:69"/> of a man toward grace, if it be not prevented. But perhaps this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine will ſeeme ſtranger then the former to ſuch as conceive <hi>Naaman</hi> to be in no forwardneſſe toward converſion at all. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> To whom I anſwer as before, that the Lord intending both his cure and converſion together, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> ſo over-ruled all occurrents in the one reſpect, as concurring to the other, beſides and above the intention of <hi>Naaman.</hi> So that his jarring with the way of God in the point of his healing, was not onely a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, but a reall let of Gods worke in that greater worke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
               <p>But then it will be demanded what forwardneſſe <hi>Naaman</hi> was in here,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Was Naaman ſo forward?</note> which was ſo letted here by his ſelfe-conceit? I anſwer: Firſt, he was very ſenſible of his aile and malady; and laid it deeply to heart; for why?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, and wherein.</note> he had wealth, honour, ſtrength, and favour with his Prince, wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might make him great: yet what were all theſe to him, having his leproſie hanging about him? Secondly, God ſends him the meſſage of a cure by ſtrange-providence of a Maids report, who told him of the Prophet: and hearing thereof, what deſire of recovery doth he bewray? How eager is he to purſue it to his uttermoſt? 1. By going to his Maſter for letters of commendation and requeſt: 2. And having obtained them, furniſhing himſelf with all ſuch proviſion &amp; rewards as he thought meet for the journey: 3. He uſeth all meanes with diligence to compaſſe this his deſire, repaireth to the King of Iſrael, the fitteſt way (as he thought) for that purpoſe; and being miſtaken in that, is glad to heare of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and to mend it ſpeedily. 4. He abaſeth himſelfe (below his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) ſo farre, as to ſtand at the Prophets doore, to crouch and creepe (in the ſenſe of his diſeaſe) for the cure thereof, with exceeding reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Prophet. All which (although they might ſeem onely natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall effects of a man under trouble) yet being orderly ſteps to a greater worke, in Gods purpoſe, and ſome of them (in a ſort) religious acts of one that acknowledged a divine power to heale him, doe argue that ſomewhat was in him toward the effect. And yet, loe, here ſteps in a techie toy, that is,<note place="margin">Yet croſſed by ſelf conceit, a toy and prich.</note> his prejudicate and foreſtalled heart conceited againſt the meane appointed by God: and this was, that he looked to be healed another way, more eaſie, preſent, and familiar to his humour,<note place="margin">How?</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Eliſha</hi> himſelfe would come forth and by applying his hand to the place, worke the miracle. And this marred all the former attempts; and beſides hindred him; firſt, from marking the meſſage which contained a plaine, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> eaſie, mercifull, and familiar way of healing, with a charge from God to waſh, and a direct promiſe of cure thereby, without any colour or excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; all which (ſo ſolemnly delivered) might very well have pierced an heart (not exceedingly prejudiced, and deluded) both for the reverence of God, and for his owne ends. If <hi>Eglon</hi> an heathen King,<note place="margin">Judg 6.</note> hearing of a charge from God (no way aſſuring him of good) was ſo obeyſant, as to come off his throne, and worſhip God, how much more might <hi>Naaman?</hi> but lo, his preconceit letted him from it: As alſo, from ſeeing his falſe heart full fraught with rage againſt the Prophet (when yet he ſeemed to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſtoope ſo low, and doe ſo much reverence:) and (to conclude) from yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> nakedly to the way of God, rather then to loſe his labour, and carry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> home his diſeaſe, and from obeying the Command.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:45715:70"/>
               <p>And juſt ſo may the caſe ſtand with ſuch as have made as many ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſteps toward converſion, as <hi>Naaman</hi> did toward his cure. They may firſt be brought to a deepe plunge under ſenſe of ſinne and the curſe,<note place="margin">Application of the ground, to the doct. in hand for the clearing of it. What faire hopes men have.</note> and that by the word of terror, convincing their conſcience: under this they may be moſt weariſome and reſtleſſe. They may be kept from ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off their terrour by other objects of pleaſure, profit or worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; they may heare of a remedy by one of wiſdomes handmaids, like well of the glad tidings, long after it, make ſpeed towards it, neglect no coſt, means, or attendance upon it; joy in the turning themſelves out of their errours and miſtakes, and the appearance of more hope of eaſe: they may honor the inſtrument with exceeding reverence; wait at the poſts of wiſdome, not houres or dayes, but moneths and quarters, thinking long till ſome ſeaſonable anſwer come unto them, thinking themſelves happy that they may ſpeed at laſt,<note place="margin">And yet how daſhed.</note> when all their labour is ended. And yet when the point ſhould come to an iſſue, and the fruit to be borne; then ſhall one ſelfe or other, either ſelfe-eaſe, or ſelfe-will, or ſelfe-wit and conceit, aſſiſted with carnall reaſon, yea, ſelfe-endeavours, ſelfe-devotion, ſelfe-mixtures of her owne with God, bereave the ſoule of all ſtrength to bring forth: one or other ſelfe (I ſay) ſhall ſtep in, or be caſt in by the divell (as the gourd into the pottage) to marre all: to ſet the chiefe worke as far behinde, as it ſeemed before to be ſet forward: in ſo much, that the voice of God both commanding to beleeve, and promiſing ſpeedy eaſe and forgiveneſſe, ſhall be as a thing farre off. And whereas the obedience of faith is, or ought to be, the upſhot of the cure: lo, this ſelfe ſhall ſo blindefolde the minde, and diſable the heart from marking, pondering, and applying the promiſe thereby, as if there were nothing in it; whereas in truth, all ſteps toward grace, without this, are frivolous: ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the baſe heart ſhall thinke this more frivolous then all the reſt; ſtumble at it, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, be diſcontent and flye off, as if it had wrong that her endeavours and paines be not accepted without it: which in truth, is no other then to quarrell with God, that her owne way may not be preferred to his, and ſeeing that may not be, rather to chooſe not to be healed at all, but abide ſtill in her old condition, then not to proſper by her owne way and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. I have deſired to open the point at large, becauſe I make it the ground of a large doctrine, whereof I would have none make queſtion. So much for the ground of the text.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Naamans ſelfe conceit and ours, may differ in the ſpeciall, though the ſame in kind.</note>But I foreſee that my hearers will by and by run to enquire whether this tech of <hi>Naaman</hi> be in their breſts or no, and whether it hath hindred their endeavours: and alſo, that all well affected Chriſtians would be loth to loſe their labour and ſweat (if they knew how to prevent it) till they have enjoyed the promiſe. And therefore I muſt tell them, that I gather a generall point from a particular: <hi>Naamans</hi> ſelfe was one branch of many; but there be many more, all as dangerous to them as this to him. Seeing then I thinke it will be deſired, that they might know the ſeverall ſorts of this monſter, and the markes of this ſecret elſe, ſelfe, I meane: therefore, ere I reaſon or apply the point, I will ſtay a while upon the diſcovery of the ſeverall ſorts of this diſeaſe, &amp; ſo returne to the point againe (if God pleaſe) in the matter of Application. I thinke none will deny, that of all other lets of grace and ſalvation, this of ſelfe, is the moſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45715:70"/> dangerous: and the reaſon is, becauſe it is moſt inward and immediate. I may ſay of it as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of uncleanneſſe, all other ſinnes are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the body, but this within, a diſeaſe of the intrailes and bowels.<note place="margin">Selfe, the moſt dangerous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, becauſe moſt inward and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate.</note> Even ſo, all other lets and enemies of Chriſt are outward; Satan hath many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, temptations by Atheiſme, by the needleſneſſe, difficulty, yea, impoſſibleneſſe of prevailing; he hath many baſe colours to delude the heart withall by the contrariety of Chriſt to the corrupt ſpirit of man: the world alſo hath many baſe and falſe principles to beat off the heart by, as the diſdaine of them that are ſo zealous,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.18.</note> the erroneous opinions which it hath of Chriſt and the profeſſion of his truth:<note place="margin">Others hurt by this moſt mortally.</note> but all theſe are without, and more eaſily avoided; the power of the Word ſooner ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters theſe miſts. The greateſt miſchiefe comes from within, and were it not for ſelfe, they could not prevaile by all their baits and feares: Selfe opens the doore and betrayes the ſoule to them. But now, to diſcerne the nature, the ſorts, and the markes of this enemy, requires ſome wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; for the which worke, although the wiſeſt is moſt inſufficient, and my ſelfe unfitteſt of all; yet the neceſſity of the point laying this taske upon mee, I ſhall adventure to ſay ſo much as at leaſt may provoke others to conſider of the matter more ſeriouſly, to conſult and give ſentence.</p>
               <p>Selfe is (to ſay truth) nothing elſe but the very ſpirit of corruption,<note place="margin">Selfe what it is in the root; viz. the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt nct of old Adam.</note> and the inſtinct of old <hi>Adam</hi> in an unregenerate heart, diſcovering it ſelfe in all other kindes, but moſt eminently (for ſlineſſe and contrarineſſe) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the worke of converſion. And it may be diſtinguiſhed into theſe two branches, either ſelfe of oppoſition to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Selfe of two ſorts: either oppoſite ſelfe to Chriſt, or mixt with him.</note> or ſelfe-mixture with Chriſt. The former whereof hinders the ſoule from Chriſt, by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and tendering to the ſoule a ſufficiency of her owne without Chriſt: the latter ſeemes to abhorre ſuch prophaneneſſe, and placeth onely ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to make the ſoule bleſſed in Chriſt alone: but in the point of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying and receiving thereof to it ſelfe mixeth her ſelfe with him, and ſcrues her ſelfe and her owne wayes into the ſufficiency of Chriſt. The former of theſe is more carnall and groſſe; the latter more cloſe and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: the former impugnes the ſole-ſufficiency, the latter the all ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Chriſt; the former the ſoule may ſooner be driven from; the latter ſhe muſt be fired out of, and (as the Fox) digged out of her burrow ere ſhe will renounce them. All Selfe is the ſpirit of corruption, but this privy ſelfe is the quinteſſence of that poyſon. All ſelfe ſets up it ſelfe againſt Chriſt;<note place="margin">Note.</note> but this is the ſecret privy-chamber wherein the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſoule imbarkes her ſelfe. For,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> as it is in the defence of a City againſt a beleaguering enemy, partly there be ſome out-workes, halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moones and retrenchments to hold the enemy at larger diſtance, and partly ſome neerer ſtronger bulwarkes and forts well manned and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with armour and Canons, in which the chiefe hopes and force of the City conſiſts: its no ſuch difficulty perhaps to drive the Citizens out of the one, but its a matter of good importance to beat them out of the other. So, I ſay of theſe two branches of Selfe; its not ſo hard a taske to diſſwade the ſoule from the former; but when the Soule runnes to her maine Fort and Caſtle, Selfe mixt with Chriſt, its an hard thing to teach her to diſcerne it, but almoſt impoſſible to fetch
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45715:71"/> her out of it. The onely wiſedome and omnipotency of grace can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that.</p>

My chiefe ſcope is to encounter the latter; yet for light and diſtinction ſake I will point at the ſeverall kindes of the former, that the Reader may not be unſatisfied about the object of the whole intended diſcourſe. For the former then which is more groſſe: this is of five ſorts; prophane ſelfe, naturall ſelfe,<note place="margin">Five ſorts of it. 1. Prophane ſelfe. 2. Naturall ſelfe. 3. Carnall ſelfe. 4.

               <p>Fire (we know) is put out by pulling away the fewell, but eſpecially by caſting on of water: ſo, all ſelfe oppoſes Chriſt, but above all ſelfe-luſts, or ſelfe reſolved to live in any ſin, doth abandon and expell Chriſt, who indeed came to deſtroy ſinne and him that reigned thereby. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſinne and Sathan held and maintained, doe moſt punctually deſtroy Chriſt. True it is, ſinne (alone and nakedly conſidered) ſerves to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie grace; for where ſinne abounded grace exceeded, and where ſinne is out of meaſure ſinfull, grace is out of meaſure gracious: but where ſinne abides in the heart as in her center and element, loved and lived in, there Chriſt is quite ſhut out of doores. Sinne is not alike dwelling in all,<note place="margin">1. Prophane ſelfe what?</note> but in ſome men it dwels without a law, ignorantly, inconvincedly; in others it rules againſt a law, rebelliouſly; and ſo the enmity of it to Chriſt doth differ in degree: howbeit in all ſuch as it dwels in, it oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Chriſt in a direct kinde of contrariety. Hence the Apoſtle deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth what agreement betweene Chriſt and Beliall,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.16.</note> the beleever and the infidell? light and darkeneſſe, ſinne, and that grace that pardons and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it?<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.19.</note> And our Saviour, They loved darkneſſe rather then light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their workes were evill. Alas! ſuch come not at Chrſt ſo much as in the remote meanes or Ordinances by their good will, or at leaſt for meere faſhion: much leſſe to the promiſe of Chriſt, to ſave them. They are alive, jolly, merry, well ſatisfied already: give them their drinke, their harlot, their world, and god Mammon, their belly, eaſe, pleaſures, or like luſts; they are well, and for the reſt, they leave it to ſuch as care for it: as for themſelves, their hell is their heaven, and Chriſt is not ſo ſweet to a needing ſoule, as that which Chriſt came to deſtroy, is ſweet to them, till the Lord ſcare them and bid them goe to their al-ſufficient luſts for ſalvation. Either they know no better, or love no better. If Chriſt ſhould come in, the kingdome which the Divell hath ſet up, and the ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he ſwayeth in their ſoules, by their prophaneneſſe, breach of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, atheiſme, pride, contention, diſdaine, intemperancy, incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſwearing, uncleanneſſe, and the like, muſt (as that ſtrong man) be caſt out by the ſtronger, and ſpoiled. And that were as ſad and uncouth to them, as the comming of thoſe Danites and ſtealing away <hi>Mica's</hi> gods was irkeſome to him: his joy, and ſtrong hold, al-ſufficient treaſure was ſtollen, and poore wretch, what ſhould it boot one ſo woe begone, to live? The laſt and chiefe reſt and content of a ſinner, being his luſts, muſt needs cauſe Chriſt, who comes to robbe the ſoule thereof, to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as he who robbes a Beare of her whelpes. Sinne and luſt to ſuch a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:45715:71"/> man is as the Lambe brought up in the boſome (as <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaith) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as his darling &amp; his ſon. Hence it is, that the ſufficiency of theſe luſts, auſe the ſufficiency of Chriſt (which ſtands in the ſetling of a ſoul upon a ſufficiency in pardon, peace and joy of conſcience) to be abhorred.</p>
               <p>I would have no man miſtake me, as if I hereby did eſtabliſh a doctrine of repentance before faith: ſundry miſtaken Scriptures have deluded the erroneous judgements of ſome Divines to thinke,<note place="margin">Repentance goes not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith.</note> that becauſe ſinne expels Chriſt, therefore repentance entertaines him: (men of unhappy aimes,) who cannot avoid one rocke, ſave by ruſhing upon another; I confeſſe in the place alleaged, <hi>Paul</hi> cites theſe words out of the Prophet, Depart and goe from among them and I will receive you, and be a father unto you, and you ſhall be ſonnes and daughters of me, ſaith the Lord Almighty. But this text ſheweth not that repentance is a ſtep to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of a man by faith and adoption: but rather it diſcovers this, That till the Lord had humbled and abaſed the Iewes for their idolatry, and ſetting up of falſe gods againſt himſelfe, and committing ſpirituall fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe with them, there was no hope of being received into favour or marriage with him. Otherwiſe, repentance and turning from idols to God, and from darkeneſſe and the kingdome of Sathan, to Chriſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth faith to purge the conſcience, and to make us beloved and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. The ſumme briefely is, That this point urgeth us not to repent ere we beleeve (which were to overthrow the need of a Chriſt, and then to come to Chriſt) but to ſhew us that ere ever Chriſt be truely cloſed with, ſinne muſt be nipt in the necke. That jollity, content and hearts-eaſe which a ſinner found in his luſts, muſt be throwne out both litter and whelpes of his heart, ere ever he come to behold Chriſt with his ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to ſave. One wombe cannot at once carry two conceptions, and the ſoule cannot at once ſerve two maſters, God and Mammon, Chriſt and luſts. The ſufficiency which luſts erroneouſly afforded to the ſoule, making her deeme her ſelfe happy in them; and to be as a man of a full ſtomacke who loathes a honey-combe, muſt be abandoned by legall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, and humbling, ere Chriſt be precious. Chriſt muſt be needed as meat by a ſterne belly, ere ever he be had. But that he cannot be, while the love of luſts, lived in, ſurfeits the appetite.

Nay, I wrong a beaſt to ſpeake ſo: to become worſe then any ſwine or beaſt, and to wallow and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate it ſelfe ſo into ſpirituall filth, as to forget what it was ever borne unto: and not onely ſo far to degenerate as to embrace the enemy of God, and that which Chriſt came to deſtroy; but to ſet up ſuch a ſufficiency to it ſelfe in it, as to aboliſh that ſole-ſufficiency of mercy to pardon and purge it! yet this I ſay of it, that although ſinne of her owne nature, and in her courſe, tends by degrees to defile, harden, and make the ſoule im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent and deſperate: yet if God breake off the ſoule betimes from it, ere it have cankerfretted the ſoule, it is more eaſie for ſuch a ſinner to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:45715:72"/> come to ſome ſence, conviction and humiliation for it, and ſo to ſome need of pardon, then many a Phariſee who under pretence of abhorring odious Publicans and offendors, is riveted into a conceit of his owne righteouſneſſe: both a Phariſee and a Publican oppoſe Chriſt; yet the former more then the latter, becauſe Chriſt came not to call the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but the ſinner to repentance. And ſo much of this, ſo farre as this Digreſſion will permit.</p>

And in a word, as there are few ſo good, but they have their tincture of ſome evill: ſo, neither are there any ſo bad, but they have ſome morall reliques left in them of vertue and praiſe. And this cauſeth them (through a baſe heart balking God in his way of Chriſt) to reſt themſelves ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that ſufficiency which they finde in theſe things; as thinking they neede ſeeke no further for any ſuperiour happineſſe, becauſe they finde this to give them ſo abundant content, both from within and from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, feeling theſe feathers and colours of their owne both to heat and to adorne them. And the truth is, this ſelfe of morality and nature is ſo much the more dangerous, by how much (in ſhew) it ſeemes ſo glorious: for how vaſt a gulfe ſeemes to be betweene the former vicious, forlorne caitiffe, and this painted moraliſt?

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe of the point.</note>Briefly then of this ſecond ſort, this I adde, Oh how lamentable is it, that a man borne to bee a ſonne of God, and beautified with his owne image ſhould become ſo diſguiſed, as having loſt grace in the ſubſtance, to reſt in a meere ſhadow thereof, deſtitute of a principle of divine life and goodneſſe! and to ſtay all ſuch from their conceit of ſelfe-ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy herein:<note place="margin">A civill eſtate dangerous.</note> let me tell them, firſt their vertue is copper coine, and wants of the nature of gold as much as kennel water of the pureneſſe of ſpring water: therefore their ſufficiency is but a dreame, a fruit of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and owlelight of diſcerning: nay it is but a madneſſe, as he muſt be a foole who really can ſatisfie himſelfe in counters as if they were pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Secondly, there is no ſafety herein, for the error of their conceit may more harden them againſt Chriſt, then the prophaneſſe of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt, if God vouchſafe them both equall light. Thirdly, if God leave them in this hardneſſe of heart, they may prove as deſperate oppoſites and purſuers of all grace of Chriſt, and Chriſtians, as the moſt horrible open ſwine, yea worſe, as we ſee in <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Iulian.</hi> Therefore (to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude) let all ſuch know, that till the Lord have lighted a torch by his word of a greater diſcovery of themſelves, then yet they have ſeene, they are farre off from the embracing of Chriſt, they are wedged alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into ſo deepe a ſufficiency of their owne, that Chriſts is unſavory. And therefore, although I will not adviſe them to renounce the vertues themſelves, nor judge them as vile as open offenders: yet I wiſh them to come under a better banner, and caſt their owne worth upon the dung-hill. They are gone up to heaven by a ladder of their owne framing and ſetting: But they muſt come downe each ſtep thereof with more ſhame and confuſion, ere they can ſet one ſtep towards Chriſts ladder: in which reſpect I ſee not but he who ſtands upon the ground ſtill, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver went higher, is ſomewhat nearer the bottome of Chriſts ladder then they.

Its true of all carnall ſavor which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, that its enmity to God: and why? becauſe its prophane and oppoſes his holineſſe. But
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:45715:73"/> its enmity to Chriſt alſo in another reſpect, to wit his alſufficiency to ſave: and why? becauſe it hath a deepe ſelfeſufficiency, and needes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: Its carried in a ſtreame and ſmooth way of it owne, its full of it ſelfe, and we know whatſoever is powred into a full veſſell runnes over. There is no peece of ſelfe more groſly oppoſite, becauſe none more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in it owne ſenſe: and when it can enjoy it ſelfe, its happy in it owne eſteeme, but if croſſed, hath no joy in being. Take ſuch a carnall mans ſufficiency from him, and he is as one that hangs in the aire. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it in a few inſtances, the prophanely carnall or Atheiſt, the worldly carnall, the learnedly carnall and ſuch as are well parted and the ſelfeloving: theſe will give a taſte of the reſt. For the firſt, the carnally prophane perſon having fleſhly wiſdome enough, perhaps policy, skill in the law, wealth at will, place and authority to backe him, how doth he ſcorne and diſdaine Chriſt, his religion and members? As thoſe jolly Captaines ſitting in councell of warre with <hi>Iehu,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1.

               <p>Alas! the very garbe of Chriſt and Chriſtianity is odious,<note place="margin">The carnall wiſe ſcorne Chriſt.</note> they ſtumble in the porch, and never get into the houſe. They feele a reall bottome of fleſh to ſubſiſt upon, which is their deep pollicy, that they can give counſell in weighty matters, foreſee outward dangers, judge of difficult caſes betweene man and man, ſway others by their authority and terrors, they ſee all glad to ſtoope to their lure, and this makes them admire themſelves: as for Chriſt, alas! he is a ſpirituall ſubject more fit for ſuch as live in a Cloiſter, affecting a contemplative life, or for Gods fooles! Tuſh! (ſay they) we ſcorne ſuch fancies as thoſe, to deny our ſelves, to beleeve a promiſe, to live upon breath, and caſting all our own ſufficiency away, to rely upon Chriſt and the word: wee love reall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and ſatisfaction, ſuch as will hold water in the world; make us eſteemed and wiſe in mens conceits: and ye ſhall obſerve ſuch as theſe, out of this ſwelling fulneſſe of their owne, behold Chriſt as a man upon the top of a pinacle beholds little children playing; yea even as mice run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our of their holes. As for preaching, they chuſe to heare none at all, but if they muſt for faſhion needes heare any, then they muſt be ſuch as in whom more ſavor of mans wiſdome appears, then power of Chriſt: ſuch as preach quaint things, faire and far off, pleaſing conceits, ſuch as leave them as they found them, and touch not their ſores. Offer them a man that preaches Chriſt or walkes in the ſpirit of humility and ſelfedeniall, and they count him a foole: (even as the carnall Jew and Gentile, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſt hmſelfe folly, and a ſtumbling blocke) geering and gibing all that comes in the likeneſſe of Chriſt or uprightneſſe.</p>

If they love a Chriſtian prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher or profeſſor, its for ſome carnall ſavor they find in his outſides, his learning, curteſie, mirth or complement: but elſe the world loves her own and ſuch as ſavor the things of this life: And by this means, they pleaſe themſelves ſo deeply in the ſufficiency and content which they get from the ſpirit of the world; that (although perhaps their conſciences ſometime pinch them for the vanity of this their ſufficiency, yet) the ſpiritualneſſe and preciſeneſſe of Chriſt is a burthen to them which they will not touch with their leaſt finger.</p>
               <p>Come in the third place to the carnallity and ſavor of good parts and endowments;<note place="margin">Carnallity of good parts an enemy to Chriſt.</note> and we ſhall finde it a woefull oppoſite to Chriſt, filling men with ſuch ſufficiency of their own, that Chriſt is a meere ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with them. They bewray this ſickneſſe (many of them) by the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of their pride and ſelfeconceit: they are as drunkards overcharged with wine, they know not how to carry themſelves, or to walke upon the ground.<note place="margin">Acts 26.24.</note> As <hi>Feſtus</hi> baſely ſpake of <hi>Paul,</hi> Much learning makes thee mad: ſo I may truly ſay of theſe, their parts and gifts doe ſo overpower them in conceit of their owne ſufficiency, that it makes them to turn mad humoriſts. And whence is that? ſurely from the impotency of that pride that is unable to keepe within bounds of moderation, and ſo muſt be within boundleſſeneſſe of humor. It was noted of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> that monſter of pride, that comming to <hi>Plato</hi> his houſe at a feaſt time, ſeeing there goodly cuſſions and tapiſtry, he tooke them and trodde on them, ſaying I trample upon <hi>Plato</hi> his pride; but he was well anſwered, that hee did it with a farre greater pride of his owne. Many worthy Grandees for their worth and skill in their faculties, Law, Phyſicke, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and other profeſſions have beene overthrowne this way, I meane by ſickneſſe of ſelfe-love and ſelfe-admiration. Some ſcorning prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not out of humility, but as thinking it under them; and becauſe its the uſuall portion of Paraſites or the reward of ſome who are ſo farre below themſelves. Others affecting ruſticall carriages or cynick quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties meane attire, little applauſe, ſmall requitalls, and diſdaining gifts and praiſe, onely to be pointed at, and becauſe they enjoy themſelves, with farre more ſufficient content, then others can ſatisfie them. And its hard to finde rare parts without ſuch tinctures: and we have ſeene the raſh adventures of ſuch, as out of the ambition to be thought ſuch, have ruſht themſelves upon ſuch rocks as have ſplit them: falſely pretending zeale, but indeed ſacrificing to their owne nets.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">This appeares in petty mat-aſwell as great.</note>How many men of learning and much reading, are ſo full of it, that they diſdaine at ſuch as goe beyond them in preaching or power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igion? They have read more bookes (they ſay if you beleeve them) then ten of theſe preciſe preachers and zealous fellowes: and this puffes them up in their own opinions; and indeed they who preach little (if their

Thoſe Phariſees who ſate in their ſchools reading their profound lectures of the Law, and having their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices ſitting at their feete, (as <hi>Paul</hi> did at <hi>Gamaliels</hi>) teaching them their Cabala, that is, their dreames, traditions, and Rabbinicall obſervations: when they ſaw the Lord Jeſus and his Diſciples goe up and downe, preaching and abaſing themſelves to the reach of the poore people,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.</note> diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dained him, as a man of no learning: they were ſtuft ſo full of their own skill and knowledge, that they ſcorned his ſimplicity. If they now lived,<note place="margin">Matth. 23.25.</note> they would preferre the waſhing of their cups and platters before prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Chriſt and repentance. Tuſh, (ſay thoſe Phariſees <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.<note place="margin">Joh. 9.</note>) Thou art borne in ſinnes, and ſhouldeſt thou teach us? This people knoweth not the Law, and is accurſed. Oh! Camels cannot enter into a needles eie, nor a man puft up in himſelfe, into the Kingdome of God. How doe ſuch as theſe beare downe preaching, eſpecially twice on the Lords day, and ſcorne them who doe ſo, as idots and dunces? And to conclude, this diſeaſe creepes into the meaneſt, even poore Tradeſmen, if they have better parts then others, to remember and repeate ſermons, to ſpeake or pray in company, (if there be not ſpeciall grace) how it makes them to bubble &amp; ſwell? I may ſay, the very braine knowledge of Chriſt, hath ſo puft up many, that they never came to ſee need of him to ſalvation: but if they may be all in all in meetings, and heare themſelves talke, and others admire them for their parts, and none contradict them, Oh this is their fools Paradiſe! This makes them think themſelves ſelfe ſufficient, and to need nothing. Nay for a need skill in mens trades may doe it.</p>
               <p>The fourth ſort is of ſuch as who ſtand upon their greatneſſe and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over others in Towns and places.<note place="margin">Carnall ſavor in ſuperioriy or greatneſſe, what.</note> They looke upon themſelves as the chiefe hinges whereon the doore turns, and they beare the purſe, others are wholly beholding to them for maintaining the poore, for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Goſpell; they beare all charges, and the whole ſway of government; and as for others, they are of the poorer ſort, and may well be ſpared, men of ſmall judgement, experience or ability to doe any thing; and this makes them ſwell in the pride of themſelves, and to ſeem great in their own opinion, though alas! they are ſo only in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the meaneſt, and being conſidered in themſelves are but ſilly and meane ones: what would theſe be if they were Magiſtrates, Juſtices and Rulers of the Country?

And (to end) the like I may ſay of the ſavor of ſelfelove, and of ſuch, as being wholly wedded to themſelves, and narrowly ſpying out all occaſions for their own ends, how their caſe, welfare, maintenance, eſteeme and credit, life, living and liberty, gaine and thrift, gifts and parts may be ſupported;<note place="margin">How dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note> neglect others, and let all ſinke or ſwim; ſo they may ſubſiſt; what care they?

               <p>This may be enough for the purpoſe of this diſcourſe, to open the truth; ſave that this one reaſon may be added, That ſelfe in welfare and wealth, hath in it the ſpirit of ſcorning the Miniſtery of Chriſt:<note place="margin">With diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine.</note> it bewrayed it ſelfe even when Chriſt himſelf preached: for it is ſaid, That ſome who heard him ſcorned him, for they were rich;<note place="margin">Luke 5.</note> and the like humor poſſeſſes their ſucceſſors. And this property agrees well with them who make the creature their ſtrong hold: as I have heard of a City beſieged, which caſt out loaves and victualls to the enemy in ſcorne, and telling them, that they were farre from ſtarving.

Chriſt himſelfe was a libertine to them and their ſtrictneſſe; a companion of Publicans and ſinners, a glutton and winebibber, in compariſon of their abſtinence and ſobriety;<note place="margin">How dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note> he could not keepe a Sabbath ſtrictly enough for them, nor walke cloſely enough to pleaſe them.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.7, 8, 9.</note> And <hi>Paul</hi> who had beene one of them, and after his converſion, bewrayed their ſecrets, confeſſed that as he truſted to his priviledges of a Jew, of circumciſion, of his ſect; ſo eſpecially that hee walked to the uttermoſt in the moſt preciſe ſtrictneſſe of his profeſſion, making conſcience of being a Phariſee; and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all his Epiſtles what doth he cry out of ſo much as his and their law righteouſneſſe, that is that exact and ſtrict walking in all the duties of the morall law and ceremonies: Oh! how this conceit of their owne ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and moralities ſtiffened, ſwelled and puffed up all this baſtardly brood, not onely to diſdaine prophane ones, but alſo to abhorre the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualneſſe of the Lord Jeſus, and to contemne the offer of his grace as baſe and ſuperfluous? And what was the chiefe object of our Saviours out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries,<note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> woes and curſes, ſave this rabble of Phariſees? (one whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being ſpent therein) yea his bitter and irreconciliable antipathy and enmity of ſpirit againſt them above all other either heathens or prophane ones: Surely becauſe he ſaw that above all other oppoſition to himſelf, this was the moſt deadly and damnable, to ſet up a god againſt a Chriſt, an Altar againſt an Altar, a righteouſneſſe comming from a meere ſelfe-loving and ſelfe ſeeking principle, from a carnall bottome, to a carnall end, againſt the eternall, ſpirituall, pure righteouſneſſe of the Lord Jeſus; who came to diſcover not onely all groſſe unrighteouſneſſe and make it odious, but alſo all righteouſneſſe of fleſh and all the obedience of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and to caſt it as unſavory ſalt, dung and dogſmeate upon the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill: And to be briefe, what elſe is the religion of our daies and times

The one boaſting of his maſſes, ſacrifices, almes, penances, empty faſtings, building of Hoſpitalls, doing of good workes, and all to eſtabliſh their owne Corban and Kingdome; through the merit of their owne congruities and condignities; the other, their ſerving of God, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his word, receiving his ſacraments, abſtaining from the ſinnes of uſury, drunkenneſſe, uncleanneſſe, and doing the duties of the Sabbath, of mercy and charity, of righteouſneſſe and equity: But to be ſure, both of them ſwelling in the opinion of themſelves; both abhorring to feele any pinching need of the Lord Jeſus and his ſufficiency, to pardon both their unrightouſneſſe and alſo their counterfeit righteouſneſſe, being both equally damnable.</p>
               <p>But the third branch, <hi>viz.</hi> Religion in point of degrees and meaſures,<note place="margin">The 3.

Others go further &amp; inſtance in the power of the promiſe of Chriſt in their ſoules: what raviſhing paſſions of joy, admiration and thankes that ſweet doctrine hath wrought in them, what pangs of deepe love and affection it hath raiſed in them, how it hath bred in them abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant weeping and ſorrow for their ſinnes, humiliation and feare under the hand of God, how they have ſtood upon thornes, till the Sabbath or lecture day came, what ardent deſires after the word, what longings, what frequent uſe of meanes it hath wrought in them, and how they have denied both luſt and liberties for Chriſt, and could be content (for the time) to beg, to goe to priſon and ſuffer for him; Beſides many effects which this hath wrought in them, the curbing in of their tongues, their paſſions, and their lives which were wont to be full of lying, deceit, rage, revenge, unmercifulneſſe, unrighteouſneſſe; but now they are become true of their word, quiet, moderate, curteous, gentle and mercifull: All theſe thinges laid together, cauſe them to thinke no leſſe then that their ſtate is good and ſound to God-ward; for why? the hearſay of Chriſt wrought all theſe things in them; And yet (not to condemne any particular perſon for theſe, ſeeing God only knowes the hearts of the ſonnes of men) how many have we knowne by wofull experience who have attained ſome of theſe or all theſe degrees,<note place="margin">And to how ſmall purpoſe.</note> who yet in a ſhort time have bewraied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45715:79"/> to bee time-fervers, and wanzed away to nothing, as faſt as ever they ſeemed to come forward?</p>
               <p>Alas! they never called themſelves to queſtion, never tried their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate by the rules of the word, nor came to put difference betweene a conſcience proceeding from ſupernaturall revealing, and betweene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and ſpirituall perſwaſion: The Apoſtle hath a ſtrange ſpeech, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.19.</note> If our hope were in this life onely in Chriſt, wee were of all men moſt miſerable: whereby we ſee, that many ſeeke their Chriſt onely for this life: that is, how they may make uſe of Chriſt here below, for a while to get themſelves ſome inward truce with an accuſing conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or to get themſelves credit, eaſe and welfare here among men, with whom they ſee Chriſt and Religion are in requeſt: But as for a Chriſt to ſave, to ſanctifie and glorifie them for ever, they never hoped or beleeved in him for that.<note place="margin">Wherein they come ſhort.</note> And why? Firſt, they never came to ſee themſelves wholly loſt and forlorne in themſelves, but ſtill held ſome prop of their owne to ſupport them, though Chriſt ſhould faile them, and ſo never feeling need of him, could never ſavingly and cordially make to him and apply him. Secondly, they never looked at a promiſe for it ſelfe, but from ſome pangs and flaſhes of ſelfe, liking the newes of Chriſt, for the good it preſented, taking the word to themſelves, rather in a dreame and a fancy after a thing they would have, then for the naked truth of the promiſer. Thirdly, or elſe they were led by outward ſenſe, the credit, gifts and plauſibleneſſe of the Preacher, in whoſe light they rejoiced, while it laſted, but if the miniſter were once removed, (then as a ſive out of the water, ſo) they loſt all their zeale againe: It bred with him and died with him. Fourthly, they heard without diſcerning of truthes, taking all alike, not cleaving to the doctrine as ſuch, able to ground and to ſettle them in peace through Chriſt: but as good thinges in generall, at randome, without putting difference, obſerving order or coherence. For, if another Miniſter came, who preached his owne va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant and ungrounded fancies, they were as ready to heare him and be led away as by the former.<note place="margin">Matth. 11.19.</note> Fiftly, they looked upon the zeale of others who ſnatch the Kingdome with violence, and thought it a diſgrace for them to bee more backward; and ſo hanging upon the common haunt and multitude, never examined what inward principle led them; and ſo, when zeale grew cold, and profeſſion more dead, they grew as cold and dead as others: Sixtly, or elſe having no roote in them, they clave to the word in peace and proſperity of the Church; but when they ſaw the times to frowne and trouble to come, then they ſaw they thruſt themſelves further in, then they had ſtrength to winde out, and ſo withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and brought ſhame upon their profeſſion: Seventhly, or if they were grounded in knowledge, yet not in ſoundneſſe of heart, for ſo ſoone as the divell came to recover his poſſeſſion,<note place="margin">Luke 11.25.</note> hee found them empty, ſwept and garniſhed, that is, ſtill tainted with old luſts, world and pleaſures, though for a while they ſeemed to have forſaken them. Eightly, though they received the truth of Jeſus, yet not as the truth is in Jeſus; not to purge them,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.21.22.</note> to change their baſe qualities, to transforme them from glory to glory: Ninthly, if they have proceeded to ſome ſhewes of holineſſe, yet they have not come under the authority of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45715:79"/> from the faithfulneſſe of the promiſer, who hath made his yoke eaſie and his burthen light: Their obedience is rather in the letter, and in the eaſier points of the Law, then the hard and craggy;<note place="margin">Matth. 11.29. 1 Sam. 13.</note> they goe not up the hill with <hi>Ionathan</hi> upon all foure, but downe hill; They are like dead fiſhes which ſwimme downe the ſtreame, not living ones which ſwimme againſt it, in ſome few thinges, not all, with an equall exact carriage, in ſome acts, not in the bent of their ſpirit, and the ſtream of their life: As the ſprings are, ſo is their running to themſelves; if they be taxed for any evills, 10. Then they excuſe them by infirmities, and lick themſelves whole by the ſores of the godly; not remembring that the godly have ſundry defects in grace, but not one (as themſelves) maine want of grace; and theſe they pretend not as excuſes; but grone under as burthens; alſo they colour themſelves by this, that their ſinnes are few, and but ſmall, or elſe neceſſary, or but ſecret and not breaking out: whereas a ſound heart knowes, one ſinne may be as full if it runne into one channell, and may be as much delighted in and fed on, as many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes; alſo that Gods people never fall into ſuch a neceſſity as to ſinne; are free from ſuch ſtraits, as to ſtretch conſcience for eaſe, credit, wealth, and outward reſpects: and laſtly, <hi>Lots</hi> wife paid as deare for her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative ſinne as for her actuall: And (to end) they abide in their evills and recover not; whereas Gods people are as a blade of good mettall which beeing bent will returne, and are never well till with the needle of the diall they ſtand juſt toward the North of repentance. Twelfly and laſtly, if they goe forward to ſuffer for Chriſt, it is with much adoe, and ſtruggling againſt it; and in ſuch ſufferings as they can licke themſelves whole another way; or if they be driven by neceſſity of ſhame or light to it, yet rather out of compulſion, then purity and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their cauſe and conſcience. And ſo much bee ſpoken for the clearing of theſe three branches of Selfe-religion.</p>
               <p>I conclude this laſt branch with admonition alſo; that we abhorre this ſufficiency of ſelfe-religion and righteouſneſſe. Its the ſtilleſt ſtreame of all, yet the deepeſt gulfe, and under pretence of drawing neareſt to Chriſt his privy chamber, becomes the greateſt traitor to him. I condemne not morality, civility, religious duties and degrees: As the Towne-clarke <hi>Acts</hi> 20. ſaid to them of Epheſus, <hi>Diana</hi> is a great goddeſſe, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it? But we muſt make no uproare for her: So, theſe are good, but they muſt make no mutiny againſt Chriſt, and by a ſufficiency of their owne, deſtroy his: If they come under his banner to fight for him, they doe well: But to erect one of their owne againſt his, is deadly treaſon. Therefore as marriners in danger of life by ſhipwracke, looke not at the value of their wares, nor the uſe of them, ſilkes, velvets, corne, wine, tacklings of ſhips, but how they endanger their lives; ſo in Gods feare let us doe with ſelfe-religion, a commodity in ſhew farre above morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or carnall welfare, but if it equally (or more) endanger the ſhip and life of the ſoule, caſt it alſo with the reſt overboord: remember not, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe five ſorts of groſſe ſelf, politiques, carnall, wizards, moraliſts, worldlings or Phariſees, get into heaven: Alas! they ſtick at the porch,<note place="margin">This ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of ſelfe muſt be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred.</note> not in the narrow gate: how then ſhould they enter? If ever God make ſuch capable of Chriſt, he will pare off their Camels bunch, and make

Be wiſe in time, lay not out their mony for no bread, nor your paines for that which ſatisfies not; empty their ſoules of it, that Chriſt and his good things, refined wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Conſider that to have this ſelfe of thine, may ſeeme ſomewhat; But to caſt all this off, and be naked and nothing; can onely prepare thee for that fulneſſe and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Chriſt which can onely ſave thee: Which grace the Lord grant thee: Thus for a more cleare handling of this argument, I have digreſſed from the ſtreame of my doctrine; it is now high time to returne to it againe. So much for this time. Let us pray for a bleſſing, &amp;c.</p>

The which I mention without any curious order, and leave them to the godly wiſe to conſider of, every one to ſingle out his owne annoyance. The firſt is ſelfe error,<note place="margin">1. Error.</note> imagining that the Lord in his promiſe and offer of Chriſt doth not ſo offer him as therewithall conveying power and efficacy of perſwading and inabling the ſoule to accept and beleeve it of it owne power, thereby creating in the ſoule the fruit of lips,<note place="margin">Eſay 57.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:45715:81"/> a way of our owne ſpeedier and quicker then we have warrant for, to wit, that if once the ſoule bee under a condition, and prepared for Chriſt, by ſorrow, deſire and diligence; the worke of beleeving is as preſent, as the grinding of the corne, when the upper milſtone runnes upon the nether: whereas faith is the ſtampe of the ſpirit, which bloweth when it liſteth,<note place="margin">3.

I meane the full appeaſing of his juſtice, by the paiment of a price; nor yet with how faithfull an heart, full and free grace he offereth, but looſely forgetting that all is yea and amen in Chriſt, and looking at the promiſe, as at a thing naked and unfurniſhed, hath a ſtrong conſolation and refuge, Heb. 7.<note place="margin">Heb. 6. penult.</note> The Seventh is ſelfe-treachery and doubtfulneſſe, whereby the ſoule having the generall offer of God to all under the condition,<note place="margin">7.

And this dart often ſo prevailes, that all the former witneſſe of the ſpirit, touching the truth of God, by many evidences ſeemes to be loſt. Ninthly, ſelfe-cavilling,<note place="margin">9.

               <p>Eleventhly, ſelfe-ſtaggering,<note place="margin">11. Staggering.</note> when the ſoule is betweene the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the promiſe, and the performance: as for example, if ſhe be urged to beleeve, becauſe the condition is already wrought, then ſhe queſtions that, whether it were ever wrought, at leaſt aright, becauſe alas! her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is little, ſhe hath never been ſo deeply tozed by the law, nor ſo bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hearted &amp; full of affections and diligence as others: on the other ſide, when ſhee feeles the condition comfortably preſent, then ſhe ſtaggers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the promiſe, ſaying, the condition is not the matter, but the beleefe it ſelf, and that is above her power, many come farre who never beleeve, and faith is the gift of God and free, and what if it ſhould never bee wrought, or ſhee ſhould die and be paſt hope, ere it be effected?

               <p>Now then I proceed to prove the point, that this mixt ſelfe (when all is done) will deprive the ſoule of mercy; if it be not prevented. Let the firſt text be that <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> We ſee they were diſappointed of the entring into his reſt: why? were not they faire for it?<note place="margin">Proofes of the point.</note> yes ſurely they had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Egypt, and come a great journey in the wilderneſſe. But what letted them? Unbeleefe. And what cauſed that? Selfe. Not only their wiſhing to be in Egypt at their fleſhpots, nor yet their fornication and Idolatry: But (as <hi>Eſay</hi> tells us) they rebelled againſt his holy ſpirit:<note place="margin">Eſay 63.10.</note> Their ſpirituall rebellings, cavillings, diſtruſt, were the cauſes: They erred in heart (as the Pſalmiſt calls it) that is,<note place="margin">Pſal. 9.2.</note> they entertained falſe conceits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, ſometime they asked, Can God ſpread a table in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; Sometime they pitied their children ſaying, Alas! We ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee Canaan: Sometime they ſaid,<note place="margin">Numb. 9.</note> the Giants were able to eat them up, there were chariots of iron: Sometimes they ſaid, this was not the way: God might as well have brought them the right way to Canaan, as the wrong, if he had meant them well. They made the promiſe of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring (eaſily and plaine in it ſelf) to be difficulter then it was: ſome ſaying, it is as high as heaven, how ſhall we get thither? can we climbe up? others thus, it is as deep as the nethermoſt earth, how ſhall we deſcend thither? is it poſſible for us, to conſtrue ſo hard a promiſe, whereof we ſee neither ſenſe or colour? to make a worke of forty daies, to be forty yeares, and yet meane us well? Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> tells them,<note place="margin">Deut. and Rom. 10.</note> ſay not the word is far off, for it is neare thee, in thy mouth, yea thine heart, that thou mighteſt beleeve it. The deceit of the erring hearts warped theſe crotchets, to hold them out of Canaan, and to ſcatter their carcaſſes in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Another text is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.15.</note> Let no man faile of the grace of God. Let there be no bitter roote ſpringing up in you, to defile you, and turne you off. He had ſpoken before of <hi>Eſau,</hi> who was the firſt borne,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:45715:83"/> and ſought the bleſſing with teares, yet failed of it: he came too late, after it was conveied away from him too ſure, to <hi>Iacob:</hi> why? he had a bitter roote ſpringing up in him, a ſelfe-willed, peeviſh heart againſt his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he diſdained that he ſhould be preferred. The Apoſtle applies it to the Hebrewes, who were faire for the promiſe (read <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3, 4,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.1, 2, 3, 4.</note> 5, 6. &amp;c.) but yet failed, and loſt it, the Gentiles were preferred. And why? there was this bitter roote of ſelfe in them, they ſtood upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, none were the Church ſave they, none ſo righteous as they; They ſcorned that dogs ſhould goe to heaven before thoſe whoſe righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was ſo preciſe as theirs: and this conceit defiled, hardned them, and overthrew the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt. They could never ſubmit ſelfe to the word preached, nor comply with it, but bitterly rejected it, and them who preacht it, as being a new way to heaven, and not that which they had learned: and ſhould they ſtoop to this new learning of Chriſt? This bitterneſſe overthrew them.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Ahaz Eſay</hi> 8.<note place="margin">Eſay 8.</note> was faire for the promiſe of victory: inſomuch as the Prophet bid him demand a ſigne: he would not: why? Selfe-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption letted him, he thought he was ſure enough of God, if once he ſpake the word: But the Lord looked at his owne honour, and therefore gave his people a ſigne, by a Virgin that ſhould conceive and bring forth a ſonne: So that the confidence of his fooliſh heart, which thought hee beleeved God, whereas in truth, he ſought himſelfe onely, and not the glory of God,<note place="margin">Luke 4.</note> deceived him. So it is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. the Phariſees and Elders comming to <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiſme, deſpiſed the counſell of God, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their ſalvation: why? becauſe they were carried with ſtrong ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudice againſt the way of <hi>Iohns</hi> Miniſtery, and choſe rather not to bee faved at all then that way. The Galathians were faire for heaven alſo, and ran well:<note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> what letted them? a miſpriſion thruſt into their heads by falſe teachers, that <hi>Pauls</hi> way and Gods way agreed not, and that the old way by Ceremonies was beſt, eaſieſt and likelieſt, becauſe agreeing with fleſh; and this makes <hi>Paul</hi> to feare, leſt he had beſtowed his paines upon them in vaine. Our Saviour Chriſts Diſciples were faire for faith: what letted them? ſelfe-ſloth, dulneſſe of heart. Oh you dull and ſlow of heart to beleeve all which is written in the Law and Prophets concerning Chriſt!<note place="margin">Luke 24.</note> in what a depth of darkeneſſe did it hold them? Their eies were held ſo downe, that they could not diſcerne the Lord Jeſus, when hee ſtood and talked with them. I will but adde one or two more, That yong man in the Goſpell was not farre from the Kingdome: what ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him? Surely he came full of himſelfe, and had kept the Law from his youth: this he had a ſtrong conceit of: but when hee was turned out of that confidence, and put into a new way of ſelfedeniall, and ſelling all, he went away ſorrowfull; not onely becauſe he was covetous, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe foreſtalled in opinion that his way was beſt, and is now croſſed.

But it is not ſo here. For when Satan can ſo delude an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound heart by the ſweetneſſe of ſelfe, as to reſiſt the dint of the truth, and harden himſelfe in his pretended religion and duties, againſt the Lord Jeſus, and the ſpirit of faith and grace, hee ſleepes ſecurely in his den, knowing that ſuch an one is under locke and key, and is not like (by any probability) to get out of ſo excuſing and erroneous a conſcience and condition: for he is as ready to damne himſelfe for his owne ends, as for Satans, and therefore is under a more deepe chaine then any other ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is.

               <p>Laſtly, how juſt is it with God to give over ſuch to the hardneſſe of <label type="milestone">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d in ſelfe fearing. The third in ſelfe withdrawing. Selfe preſuming is that corruption which holds off Chriſt in the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Law &amp; Goſpel: ſuch as theſe, feeling of the ſoul to be in an utter ſtrait, and in an abſolute need of Chriſt; mourning after him, deſiring him, and taking paines for him, with the like. Theſe all (if they be ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought in the ſoule) proceeding not onely from legall abaſement, but alſo Evangelicall tidings of peace by the good things which onely Chriſt hath purchaſed, cannot proceed from any principle in our ſelves. Howbeit ſelfelove is ſo prone to preſume of that to bee wrought truly in us, which ſhe covets and wiſhes to be wrought, out of a deſire of her own welfare, that ſhe eaſily mixes her ſelfe with the offer and promiſe, and (not ſtaying her full time to weigh du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y the nature thereof) takes her owne pangs and hopes and ſelfeloving conceits to be true preparations: Now whereas every abiding worke of grace muſt have a principle in it above ſelfe-ends and ſelfe-love, therefore, what marvell if ſuch flaſhes of preſumptuous ſelfe, vaniſh and leave the ſoule, as new to beginne as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it was?<note place="margin">2. Self-fearing.</note> A ſecond degree is ſelfe fearing, which may befall him who hath ſhot the former gulfe: for it lies in another extremity: and runnes as much on the left hand, as the other did on the right: thinking (though ungroundedly) that although ſome worke hath beene begunne in the ſoule, yet ſeeing many have gone farre and periſhed, faith is of few, and the free worke of the ſpirit, which bloweth onely upon ſome: alſo fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling fearfull untowardneſſe in her ſelfe, darkeneſſe, dulneſſe, deadneſſe and unworthineſſe, doubting alſo of her election or ſanctification, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe ſhall never renounce her luſts or perſevere: upon theſe or the like feares, ſhe concludes ſhe belongs not to God, nor ſhall beleeve. Now this feare (a man would thinke) were rather ſelfdeniall then ſelfe: but in very deed, it is often diſcovered, to be a more tenacious enemy, then the former: for why? it trencheth horribly upon the ſimplcity of the offer, the power and truth of the promiſer, as if it would ſet grace at a <hi>non-plus,</hi> and as if the Lord were a tyrant, a lyer, ſo doth it claſpe to it ſelfe, will not be beaten out of her den,<note place="margin">3. Withdrawing ſelfe.</note> nor reſigne up her ſelfe to God. The third and laſt degree, is yet moſt dangerous of all, I meane withdrawing ſelfe, and may be conceived to be the laſt corner of the ſtrong fort of ſelfe in her oppoſing of Chriſt, and to prevaile with many, whom the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer two could not foile. Marke it well. And it is that wofull and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate flinging out of the ſoule, and incompliableneſſe of the ſpirit, with the onely and ſound way of God to ſave the ſoule, which is faith, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, pacifving, converting and changing the heart to God. Which way, when the cloſeneſſe, ſolemneſſe, nakedneſſe and neceſſity of it, is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:45715:85"/> preſented to the ſoule, it findes her marvellouſly wrapped and wound in, with abundance of ſuch ſecret ſcurſe of her owne: that firſt, ſhee begins to be offended at the purity, ſpiritualneſſe, and holineſſe of it, as farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding her carnall comprehenſion or content, as the heavens exceed the earth: ſhee ſees not how it is poſſible for two ſuch extremities to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. And ſecondly, ſhe feeles ſuch a Law within herſelfe, ſuch an horrible repugnancie of heart againſt this way, ſuch an old cuſtome of formality in Religion, eaſe, ſloath, reſtineſſe and luskiſhneſſe of ſpirit (as <hi>Rahel</hi> ſitting upon her Idols, and loath to ſtirre) that this way workes her to extreame unwillingneſſe to conſent and obey: ſhee wiſhes (from her heart) that the command of faith were of a ſhorter ſize, and a narrower extent: ſhe fore-caſts ſuch an utter miſery in ſelling her ſelfe and all, for the gaining of a promiſe, as the young man did,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. ult.</note> when he was bidden to ſell all; and therefore concludes, The price is too great, the commodity (as good as it is) is too deare, how ſhall it ſtand with ſelfe? What will old froth and vanity, liberty and looſeneſſe of heart, of thoughts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſay to this geare? ſhe muſt (for ought ſhee ſees) conſult with them, and have their good wills, ere ever ſhe can conſent: here's the pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Selfe will not yeeld, her old bent, frame and ſtreame is carnall, or at leaſt but mixtly, and halfe religious; and therefore to caſt that out, would make her forlorne and a begger, an unſubſiſting creature without a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. On the other ſide, God will not yeeld, his bent and end is to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the ſoule to himſelfe, to bring her within his owne narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, to be all in all to her (as ſelfe was before) the meere and naked bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of her joy &amp; welfare: he hath given his Sonne to purchaſe the ſoul thus to himſelfe: He hath denied his glory and himſelfe, that hee might thereby win the ſoule to magnifie him in his love, and glory in his grace, and therefore he will not loſe his ends. Except then the controverſie bee determined, and the ſoule drawne up, and overcome, to reſigne up and raze this fort of Selfe, and truſt God with her owne ſoule for mercy, and for powerfull ſubduing of her ſelfe: This laſt degree will make her rather to chuſe the forfeit of heaven, then of her owne will and content. And this may ſerve for the three degrees of mixt or ſecret Selfe. Now I come to the ſecond part of the anſwer, touching the foot-ſteps and paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of this enemy, and ſo to end the queſtion.</p>
               <p>Concerning which I ſay,<note place="margin">Secondly by her paſſages. Three. 1. Ground of Selfe is fleſh.</note> that the paſſages of ſelfe may bee conceived in theſe three particulars: Firſt, in the ground of it: ſecondly, in the car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riage of it: thirdly, in the ſcope and iſſue of it. For the ground or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of it, it is Fleſh: that which is not from Grace, is no better then fleſh, ſeeme it what it will; and that may appeare both in Legall ſelfe and Evangelicall. For Legall ſelfe, I may ſay that which the Holy Ghoſt, Eſay 58.<note place="margin">Eſay 58.</note> ſpeakes of Hypocrites, that even in their faſting (which was ſelfe-afflicting, Levit. 23.<note place="margin">Levit. 23.</note>) yet they had pleaſure: they kept their falſe meaſure within, and nouriſhed ſuch a carnall heart, as cauſed their humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation to be defiled: ſo is it here. If we knew who were elect, and who not (as we cannot) we might as well diſcern them by a defect of Legall, as well as Evangelicall preparations: for Chriſt is Alpha and Omega,<note place="margin">Revel. 1.</note> the beginning and end of the ſalvation of his owne. So that (as common a worke as the Law is accounted) ſure it is, that ſelfe hath her bredth in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:45715:86"/> that narrow, and admits not ſuch abaſement as the Law worketh in the elect, but rather ſhe hath pleaſure, and beares off the dint, by ſome exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of her ſin, or other, even then when ſhe ſhould receive the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing knife to cut the throat,<note place="margin">Both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Law and the Goſpel. 1. The Law.</note> that is, to ſlay the pride and jollity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſhe lickes her ſelfe whole (if ſhe can) as faſt as the Law wounds. But if it ſo fall out, that the Lord is purpoſed to breake in upon ſuch a ſoule with his terrours, and to caſt her downe to the ground, ſo that ſhee is under water, and terrified to purpoſe; yet herein ſelfe appeares, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe windes herſelfe out as ſoone as the extremity is over, by indirect meanes, or elſe the ſtrait ſhee is in, is no meanes to drive her out of her ſelfe to another, but rather to fret and rebell, thinking ſhe hath wrong: or ſhe growes thereby to thinke herſelfe to be in a better caſe, becauſe ſhe is ſtopped in her old courſe: or if the utmoſt extremitie comes ſhe chuſeth rather to rid her ſelfe from it by violence, and deſtroying of her ſelfe, rather then to ſee God in the worke. But not hereby to behold the clear way of God, to bring the ſoule to a condition of grace, when ſhe is at an utter loſſe and plunge in her ſelfe. For then this worke ſhould leave her better then it found her, that is, cauſe her (upon a ground of the Word) to ſee herſelfe within Gods net and ſo to grow to conceive ſome poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and hope, which is too lively a worke for ſelfe to reach unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Goſpell: and that both in the eye-ſight,</note>Secondly, in reſpect of the Goſpel, ſelfe is but fleſh: The Goſpel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents Chriſt to the beleeving ſoule, dearly and favorly; but ſelfe failes in both her eye-ſight and heart-ſight of him: I mean, both in underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and will. For the firſt, ſelfe cannot ſee ſo much of Chriſt, as God offers in his Goſpel; ſhee beholds onely ſuch an excellencie of Chriſt offered therein, as is ſevered from the gift to receive him with, which (upon poynt) is as good as nothing: for it is but a ſhread of Chriſt, which an hypocrite may have,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. Epheſ. 4.21.</note> Rom. 2.5.6. But a poore ſoule ſees Chriſt even as the truth is in Jeſus, and as hee is offered to the ſoule; that is, not as a bare price of pardon and peace, but as a thing enabling the ſoule to buy, and receive him into her own boſome.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30.</note> Of him, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> are we, who is made unto us of God, &amp;c. Marke, not as onely as cloath, which will make a garment, but as a garment fitted for us, and ready made: for that he ſerves for, both covering and defence. As the twy-light differs from the brightneſſe of the morning Sunne upon the top of an hill, whence a man may ſee all the wide sky: ſo doth a beleeving ſoule and ſelfe differ in beholding Chriſt. That which is ſaid in another ſenſe, Matth. 24.<note place="margin">Matth. 24.</note> That the Sonne of mans day ſhall bee as the light which ſhineth from Eaſt to Weſt: that may bee ſaid of Chriſt offered to the eye or minde of a beleever, that the whole light (for kinde) of the Sonne of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,<note place="margin">Matth. 13.11.</note> is diſcovered to him. As our Saviour tells his Diſciples, To you I ſpeake clearly, to others in Parables, that ſeeing they might not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, becauſe they will not; ſelfe putting in a condition of her owne, which God puts not: For the Lord ſo offers Chriſt, that the vertue of the offer becomes to a broken ſoule both price and Chapman; yea, breeds that in the ſoule which it offers even faith to embrace it. But ſelfe puts in a condition, If I can accept it. Shee would in a ſort bee cloathed and fed upon her own purſe. Now this condition God puts into the offer, I will create the fruit of the lippes,<note place="margin">Eſay 57. Jer. 31.31.</note> I will take out the heart of ſtone, I will write
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:45715:86"/> my Lawes in their heart, and cauſe them to beleeve, &amp;c. Selfe heares theſe things as the noiſe of many waters: I ſee (ſaith ſhee) an excellent thing offered to ſuch a one as can receive it; and then ſhee goes about to perform the condition her ſelf, hoping thereby to compaſſe Chriſt: But this labour might be ſpared, if ſhe beheld the offer aright, as able both to prepare the ſoule with brokenneſſe and emptineſſe, and alſo to beget faith in it. The honeſt ſoule puts faith into Chriſt crucified, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, ſaying thus; If the Lord will ſave mee, I will let him alone alſo to worke faith in me, by the <hi>Merit</hi> and worth of the thing offered; for why? God doth not offer me a dead Chriſt, but a quickning Spirit,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> not as a bare object of excellencie, ſerving to enable me to concurre with him of my ſelfe, and to be a partner with him in the poynt of application; but as a purchaſe of ſatisfaction to juſtice,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30.</note> and alſo of faith for mee to embrace it with, that he who boaſteth might boaſt in the Lord. Oh! if ſelfe could know the gift of God, and who it is who offereth (one that can doe that for us which he did for that woman, Joh. 4. and that blinde man, Joh. 9. while he talked with them) what a light would it afford to the ſoule? The ignorance of this cauſes the ſoule to bee in as deep a ſtagger after Chriſt is revealed, as it was before: for why? Selfe is ready to cavill, Lo, God offers Chriſt as one ſhould offer an hundred pound to one for the running of a mile, whoſe legges are cut off. But a needing ſoule, ſet out of, and beyond her ſelfe, ſpins out all her hope and helpe from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, truſts not to her own ſteppes which ſhe makes to Chriſt, but to the ſteps which Chriſt makes toward her, both as her price and Advocate to apply it, 1 Joh. 7.8. Joh. 8.22. the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Selfe failes alſo in the Heart-ſight of Chriſt.<note place="margin">And the heart ſight of Chriſt</note> For although ſhe hath ſome glimpſe of affections toward the things of the Goſpel; yet ſhe ſavours them onely as things good to her ſelfe (ſo long at leaſt as that ſavour laſteth) and promiſe to her ſome welfare. A carnall heart muſt be pleaſed, and the Lord Jeſus muſt ſerve to that purpoſe. But a poore needing ſoule ſo ſees Chriſt offered, as by that ſight all other objects of ſenſe are eclipſed, yea diſpoſſeſſed; receiving thereby ſuch a bottome of ſpirituall reſt and content into the ſoule, as needs no other falſe bottome to eike it out withall. Selfe ſo apprehends Chriſt as an object of good, making up ſome formerly enjoyed good, not able to ſatisfie of it ſelfe: and ſo both holds her owne ſtill as eſſentiall, and addes another to it, as onely a bettering of another, not a caſting out of another, that Chriſt might be all in all; that he, I ſay, might be in ſtead of Selfe. A pearle to one that findes it, is both houſe and ground, ſheep, cattell, pullen and all, makes all baſe, &amp; to come under the worth thereof: So doth Chriſt bear downe Selfe, and becomes to the ſoul that which all wealth, eaſe, ſports, company, pleaſure and content could bee. Selfe ſoders matters of all ſorts together, and makes an Image of all mettals mixed with clay, joines a horſes creſt and ſhoulders to the head of a man. Why is this? becauſe Chriſt is not revealed to the heart, as her <hi>Adaequate</hi> and full object; ſhee heares of him, as the Jewes dream'd of releaſe, an halfe object of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, not as an excelling good; in compariſon of which all former are dung and droſſe. Satan ſo blindes the eyes of Selfe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.4.</note> that this glorious ſight never comes at the heart, to poſſeſſe and fulfill it.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:45715:87"/>
               <p>I ſay, Selfe ſhuffles and huddles all together, and reacheth at the Lord Jeſus, with that carnall ſavour, wherewith ſhee reacheth at profits and pleaſures: (as a fulſome fellow, who complements with all ſorts alike) ſo he be ſatisfied with any thing, he is glad. As for diſcerning of things that differ, and aſcribing the maine eſteeme of heart, to that which beſt deſerves it, out of judgement and ſavour what is beſt, hee is farre from it, onely the honeſt heart ſees a peculiarity of ſavour, gaine and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Chriſt: and (as once the Oracle bid them that asked who ſhould have the Kingdome, Give it the beſt) ſo ſhee gives up her ſelfe, with all her content and delight, even her Kingdome and prerogative, to the beſt, the true and undoubted Lord, even Chriſt: ſhee ſeparates the pretious from the vile, as if a man ſhould diſtinguiſh his love to a ſervant (both for kinde and meaſure) from the love of a wife or childe. The oddes is, as the hony which <hi>Ionathan</hi> taſted upon the top of his rod, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of eating it to fulneſſe and ſtrength for the purſute of the enemy. When the Lord doth not reach out by pieces and parcels of Chriſt, but throwes him into the ſoule with his whole heart and treaſure (as one would caſt his deare wife purſe and all, that ſhe might know his bounty) and gives the ſoule more then ſhe can aske or thinke (as <hi>Salomon</hi> to the Queen of Sheba, more then all ſhe deſired) then the ſoule hath an heart-ſight and view of him. Then ſhe is ſatisfied fully with his image, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving from his fulneſſe, that is, his heart fully reconciled, and ſatisfied by his Sonne, that can deny them nothing: And ſhe beholds in this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, as much above all goodneſſe which <hi>Adam</hi> enjoyed, as heaven is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an earthly Paradiſe. Briefly, Selfe foſters two contents at once, one from a Principle of her owne being carnall, the other from an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall &amp; violent: ſo that in time, the carnall prevails againſt the violent, and the violent vaniſhes. Some hold out and make a ſhift to deceive themſelves longer then others: but, except they grow to ſee their errour, and to ſet up the object of their joy above the carnall, they vaniſh into miſery. And this for the ground of Selfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond generall: The carriage of Selfe is ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the root or ground.</note>The ſecond generall poynt is, the carriage of Selfe. And marke, ſelfe in her grounds muſt needs bee like her ſelfe in her carriage; I meane, in thoſe performances which come from her. Nothing can worke beyond her owne Spheare: of Selfe and Fleſh, no act ſave fleſhly, can proceed. She will not ſuffer her own chanell to lye dry. So that, what ever means ſhe uſeth, faſting, prayer, meditating, hearing, conferring, whatſoever paines ſhe takes for a broken deſirous heart; whatſoever duties or graces ſhe doth, or makes ſhew of, ſhe can riſe no higher then her Spring and Fountaine lies. Selfe keeps center within, and acts all, as ſuppoſing there is a congruity and directive or procuring cauſe of grace in her. Shee lookes to win the Spirit of grace by the ſpirit of Selfe, not to loſe her owne ſpirit by the Spirit of Grace. She is not ſenſible of any thing ſave what comes from her ſelfe, and thinkes very well of any thing which ſhe feeles to proceed thence. And ſo will any ſoule confeſſe, which the Lord hath freed from this bondage. That all his performances were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſave a willing and running of their owne, though (while he was in his element) all ſeemed pleaſant. There is a way which ſeemes pleaſant to a man while he is in it, though when he is once out, hee ſees it tended
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:45715:87"/> to death. And as hee in <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, There is a ſpirit in man (ſuch as it is) which will be doing, and will have one finger in every buſines: but it is the inſpiration of the Almighty which muſt give underſtanding. I deny not, but Selfe (according to her light) admits of many degrees; yet all in one kinde, but as one ſpake of Uſurers and Theeves, one was leſſe oppreſſing then the other, yet the beſt would bite: So I ſay here, bad is the beſt of Selfe, ſhe will be chiefe in all matters, nothing muſt paſſe, but through her fingers; all the Corne muſt be fetcht home in her Cart, and ſome peece (at leaſt) there muſt be of her, and all to keep her from ſelfe-deniall, and from a promiſe (which are her two terrible objects) within her owne precinct.</p>
               <p>Which may appeare in theſe few paſſages: Firſt, in her inſtinct:<note place="margin">How that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares: v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A word or two of each. For the firſt, her inſtinct and ſavour which ſhe is carried by, is not godly, or holy, but earthly and baſe. As we ſay, Nothing in Popery is carried beyond the ſavour of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, eaſe, and the belly: ſo in ſelfe-religion nothing ſmells of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſave her owne wiſedome and ends, as here we ſee in <hi>Naaman,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſavour'd or reliſht with his noſtrils, or appetite, ſave to be his owne carver, and to appoint the Prophet a way of his owne.<note place="margin">1. Her inſtinct.</note> Aſſiſtance and aid comes not faſt enough from any other fountaine ſave her owne. As the Egyptian Midwives ſpake of the women of Iſrael, they were not as other women, but quicke of travell ere the Midwife came at them:<note place="margin">Exod. 1.</note> ſo is it here, it is a weariſome waiting for Selfe to wait in paine, till the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife of a promiſe come to them, they can diſpatch more eaſily then ſo. When <hi>Paul</hi> and the Pilot were with the Centurion, the Centurion ſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> but the Pilots. One crotchet of her owne,<note place="margin">Act. 27.</note> how her edge ſtands to ſuch a Text, Doctrine, Sermon, Promiſe, and what her thoughts are of it, is more to her, then what the inſtinct, ſcope and ſavour of the Spirit aimes at; ſhee weighes out to her ſelfe Gods treaſures, not according to the Ballances of the Sanctuary, and the weights thereof, but her owne (not halfe ſo bigge) and ſo ſhee is found but light. The reaſon is, ſhe is not altered in ſubject, that is, in her ſelfe, but in object onely. Now the object cannot alter the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it ſelfe, without the grace thereof concurre therewith. And therefore in all her acts ſhee conſults with her owne likings, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and feelings, as the Muſitians eare with the tune or jarring of his ſtrings.</p>
               <p>Secondly, her endeavour is ſuteable:<note place="margin">2 Her endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</note> ſhe loves (for the moſt part) ſuch performances as are more eaſie, pleaſing and welcome to the fleſh, balk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe which are more ſpirituall and ſelfe-deſtroying, preferres a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in generall, before a ſpeciall manner of it, and hearing or reading before meditation; ſingle prayer before ſecret or continuall, or occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, or faſting, &amp;c. And in this endevour of hers, ſhe hath no ſcruples, but thinkes they ſhall prevaile. If (ſaith ſhe) I doe ſo, and ſo, read, pray, deny my ſelfe in ſuch a liberty, or doe ſuch a duty, I ſhall prevaile; not adding this, if I doe it in or by the warrant of ſuch a word or promiſe, carrying the ſtrength of God therewith, and look at my own endeavour as the ſervant of grace onely, without any ſtrength of mine owne, I ſhall
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45715:88"/> proſper. And hereunto adde this, That ſhe reſts in her endeavour, never harkening what God will anſwer, and whether he ſpeake peace or no; but reckoning her worke for a price. This deluſion is an inſeparable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill from ſelfe. As the Preachers zeale, gifts, perſwaſions, are as her own performances, and as her morall weighings of matters have beene, ſo muſt grace needs follow: God muſt be tied to a neceſſity of bleſſing all which comes from ſelfe, whether ſhe ſet God as chiefe above them, or her ſelfe above him, all is one: ſhe examines nothing by the rule of right going to worke, but reſts in the deed done; yea, let what objections will, come in their way, they are at a point, and returne to their owne bent, thinking that the children of ſuch prayers and duties cannot periſh: As thoſe Jewes told Chriſt, of the Maſter of the Synagogue, he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved he ſhould heale his daughter for his good workes ſake. But if ſelfe were as ſhe ought, ſhe ſhould come in as that man did and tread himſelfe in the dirt, Maſter I am not worthy that thou ſhouldeſt come under my roofe: ſo that in themſelves they can feele ſomewhat to truſt too, (though it be nothing) but in the Lords promiſe (bee it never ſo evident) they feele nothing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the motion of Selfe is eager and violent; ſhe wants that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward moover of the ſpirit,<note place="margin">3.

                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:45715:95"/> ſaith) By this, man liveth. And <hi>Iob,</hi> cap. 33. <hi>Elihu</hi> tells us, Hereby, even by the corrections which he hath ſealed (ſuch as he there mentioneth) conſumptions,<note place="margin">Eſay 3.8.</note> fevers and diſeaſes which take away ſtomack and the like, the Lord hideth the pride of man, which is ſelfe: he brings to the pits brinke of the grave that he may keep the ſoule from hell, even the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt pit. Oh! when the bladder of Selfe, and Pride, and Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, is prickt, and the bubbling froath, and windy puffing thereof, is let out, a man comes to ſee himſelfe as hee is, a forlorne creature; then his duties, affections, hopes, ſorrowes, deſires and performances vaniſh: no man can ſo baſely thinke of him, as he conceives of himſelfe, then hee is vile, &amp; duſt and aſhes in his own eyes! Who is more free from all arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to himſelfe and his owne righteouſneſſe, then one that lies all pale, and conſumed with paine and ſickneſſe? When we doe meet with one, (except ſome deſperate blinde Phariſee) who in his extremity dare truſt to himſelfe? where is then his vain-glory, his boaſting of devotions, faſts, prayers, and alms? Alas! the image of them is deſpiſed, the pride of life is crack't, and the great ſtomacke is broken: and then his high thoughts, which exalted themſelves againſt Chriſt, and an humble heart, quaile and come downe.<note place="margin">Croſſes are great meanes to let out Selfe out of the Soule.</note> Then if an interpreter come, one of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, to declare his righteouſneſſe, how welcome is hee? When the heart is empty of Selfe, then doth the Lord commonly fill it with good things; and when it deſpaireth of ſelfe-hope, then the Lord ſaith: Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, I have received a ranſome.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that <hi>Iob,</hi> cap. 10.12. ſaith: Thy viſitations (O Lord) have preſerved my ſpirit. And the truth is, it is well in theſe dead times, if any thing will doe it! As <hi>Paul</hi> Phil. 3. ſaith, If by any meanes I may attain it. The word (without ſome afflictions upon mens ſpirits, or name, bodies or poſterity, and that in ſome ſtinging kinde) pierces not; the ſpirit is ſtraitned. Sometims after long ſtruglings and wraſtlings of men with this Selfe, hoping to picke ſomewhat out of their owne ſtrength, they are tired and wearied in their way, and their former feares come upon them a-freſh, ſo that they can finde no reſt in their bones: Then they begin to conſider ſeriouſly of it, and conclude, There is a pad in the ſtraw: ſtill they croſſe the worke of God in one kinde, as faſt as they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it another: Surely they reſolve an heart of hollowneſſe, ſloath, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſſe and loathneſſe to renounce the creature, or their ſtoutneſſe, and ſullen heart, or the warmth of their owne feathers, their zealous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Theſe or the like oppoſe the nakedneſſe and ſimplicity of the promiſe, and keep the conſcience in ſnares and defilements, and they cry out, Miſerable men! who ſhall deliver us? And ſometimes by other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, the Lord is faine to ſharpen the point of his convincing ordinance, that the Soule may think the Lord is in ſad earneſt, when ſhe findes him to hunt her out in every corner, and give her no reſt till ſhe can be content to be ſaved any way, ſo ſhe may be ſaved: A very Papiſt in his ſtraits will diſclaime himſelfe, and ſay, It is ſafeſt for the avoyding of vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to cleave onely to mercie, and ſhall we that profeſſe none but Chriſt, come ſhort of them?</p>
               <p>To conclude then, as we read Heb. 12. My ſon, refuſe not the chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Lord,<note place="margin">Job. 7.18.</note> nor grudge at his viſitations, as <hi>Iob</hi> once murmured. Why doſt thou viſit him every morning, and try him every moment? Why
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:45715:95"/> doſt thou ſet mee as a marke againſt thee? But in the iſſue of that great trouble, he was of another mind, ſaying, cap. 9.31. My very cloathes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file me: And cap. 42.4. Now have I ſeene thee; therefore I abhorre my ſelfe. Let us doe likewiſe, and abhorre our owne murmurings at our croſſes: for although they are irkſome to the fleſh, yet they are whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for the ſpirit; as we ſay of the body, that when the ſpleen is ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt, that is beſt: So, the body of grace is at beſt, when that Spirit in us which luſteth to envie, to ſelfe-love and carnall ends, is brought loweſt. Rejoyce therefore, and attend cloſely to this worke of Gods viſitation.<note place="margin">Jam. 4.4.</note> Say as once one anſwered to him that diſcouraged him from <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> voyage, by the wants and affronts which hee ſhould meet with there, and in his journey, as lacke of diet, good lodging, and the like: Oh (ſaith he) what know I, but by this abaſement, the Lord will crucifie me to this world, and the contents of it, marriage, pleaſures, travelling up and down, belly, gain, &amp; the like? What ſhall I loſe by this bargain? <hi>David</hi> in his heavie affliction of ſpirit, Pſal. 51. could ſay, My ſinne is ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me! yea, the ſinne of his Nature, and that Selfe, the ſeed of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, was then terrible: whereas before in his jollity, neither murther nor adultery was ſenſible. Looke up to God, and beſeech him, that in this glaſſe of conſcience, affliction I meane, thou mayſt behold the thiefe that doth thee all the hurt; that Grace by little and little may drop in, and Selfe goe out, that thou mayſt partake his righteouſneſſe, who emptied himſelfe of all, mayſt learne obedience by ſufferings, and behold that venome which hath drunke up and waſted the ſpirit of ſelfe-deniall and faith, and marred all thy hearings, and uſe of meanes till this houre: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this caveat I add, Let no man aſcribe more to croſſes then is their due. They cannot worke of themſelves, ſave in and by the Word: But where the ſeed lieth under the dry clod, this ſtorme may poſſibly moyſten and breake it, and cauſe the ſeed to root and grow up.

And that is to teach us what the reaſon is of ſo much irreſolution and ſtaggering in the ſpirits of many Profeſſors:<note place="margin">Staggering &amp; unproficiencie of Chriſtians in the fruit of Selfe.</note> why their faces are all ſo pale, &amp; their hands are upon their loyns and ſides, as a womans whoſe paines are upon her, the fruit being come to the birth, but no ſtrength to bring forth? Where almoſt are there any other now-a-dayes to bee found? (except wee meane ſuch as never came to feele themſelves in a ſtreit at all:) ſure it is, their number is great, who (although in meaſure they affect the beſt things, and to ſet ſuch a price upon them, as that they are loath to goe without them at laſt: yet) ſtill profeſſe they can attaine ſmall ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledneſſe, and reſt upon the promiſe with perſwaſion &amp; comfort. Surely the reaſon is, becauſe (although as they conceive) that deſire which is in them toward God, comes from the Word which hath convinced them of their need; yet either they are ignorant of that which is able to ſettle them, viz. the freedome of the promiſe of forgivenes comming from the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:45715:96"/> heart of a reconciled God in his Sonne: or elſe will take no paines to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt and rivet it in their owne hearts; but chuſe to wanze away in their owne inconſtancie, being glad when they feele any affections ſtirring in them; but when they are cold and dead in their ſpirits againe, then their hopes turne to feares; and leave them ſo conceited, as if there were no way left for them to recover any ſetling or confidence. This policie of Satan to hold hearers upon this rolling ſtone of their owne bottomes, is no other, ſave that he blind-folds them with this Selfe and ſelfe-love. For why? ſo long as they were meerly carnall, and led by prophane Selfe, they confeſſe, God might juſtly caſt them off. But when once they finde their mindes and hearts to be truely bent, and ſet heaven-ward then they conceive themſelves as other manner perſons, and thinke that no man can blame them if they looke for ſome fruit of their labour; and wonderfull difficult it is to draw them from a carnall ſavour, even in the moſt ſpirituall things of God. Wherefore (ſay they) have we zeale and feelings, and hopes by our hearing the promiſe, ſave that wee ſhould aſcribe ſomewhat to them, and thinke our ſelves in better caſe then when we wanted them? And whence are they, ſave from the word and the glad tidings of the Goſpel? To whom I anſwer, I grant all to be true which you have ſaid: but what then? Is there no difference (thinke you) betweene the newes of ſalvation offered to a needing ſoule, rejoycing to heare that one lying in the dungeon may come out and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in ſome hope that it may be his owne portion, and betweene one who is actually drawne out of it, by applying thoſe cords to himſelfe, which God hath laid before him, I meane by beleeving the promiſe to be his owne? Are there no degrees of the worke of the Goſpel, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fall in love with it, becauſe it pleaſes us? Put caſe the Lord is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at firſt to draw us with the cords of a man, that is by an object which is welcome to nature, while we are uncapable of further things; ſhall this ſatisfie the ſoule, and make it by and by to thinke it ſelfe in good caſe?</p>
               <p>Is there not a condition of the offer, as well as ſome preparations wrought by the offer? or ſhall ſome pangs of hope, jealouſie, ſorrow, loathneſſe to forgoe the promiſe, be ſet by as much as the promiſe it ſelf beleeved? No ſurely, for ſo the Maide ſhould bee preferred before the Miſtreſſe, and thoſe paſſions of the ſoule which God uſeth for the pulling of her cloſer to himſelf, in the embracing the offer, ſhall be equalled with faith it ſelfe, which were moſt abſurd: For why? faith is a worke iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the digeſtive power of the Spirit, ſo urging the faithfull mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of God, reconciled to a ſinfull wretch in Chriſt, that he is willing to put away all enmity, and become a father to pardon her and ſet her at liberty: whereupon the ſoule ſo faſtens, that finding ſuch properties in her ſelfe, as belong to ſuch an one; ſhee with holy and humble bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, takes them to her ſelfe as her owne portion never to be taken from her. To apply the anſwer, the cauſe of ſuch ſtaggering is ſelf-love. That which you feele to agree with your ſelves, and to come eaſily, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth you too well, and cauſeth you to dwell upon it too long, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold you from better things. The remedy of your diſeaſe muſt bee, to aſcribe no more to your ſelves, but to the glory of grace, to abaſe ſelfe,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45715:97"/> and to exalt mercy, to renounce all ſelfe-reflex from duties and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors of your owne, becauſe they cannot ſhed any meritorious bloud to ſave you, and to claſpe to that promiſe which is eſtabliſhed upon a ſatisfaction to juſtice; which though it be out of your ſelves, yet is (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort) made your owne by him that promiſeth; becauſe faith is his gift, and he hath covenanted to give it you for that end and purpoſe. What skils it how little grace you feele within, when as he who offereth you mercy, onely ſeeke ſuch as want it, that he may have the glory? Or what ſhall it boote you to thinke you have leſſe ſinne then others, when as he who calls you to forgiveneſſe, cares not how great it be, ſo it hinder not your beleeving in him,<note place="margin">Read this wiſely.</note> who ſeekes the ſuperabounding of grace where ſinne hath abounded?

               <p>Be content to gird your ſelves and ſerve grace, and let not grace at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend you, as if you had wrong if it be not laid in your laps, but come under the banner and authority of it, the ends and honour of it. It is ſomething that grace runnes in your ſtreame, but your ſtaggerings ſhall never ceaſe, till your ſtreame be dried up and turned to runne meerly in Gods ſtreame, to be carried, both whither, how ſoone, how and how farre it ſhall pleaſe him: Uſe all meanes, walke ſo in the way, as making uſe of all incouragements; but ſtill looke forward to the price of the high calling of God: boaſt not your ſelves, as if you had put off your harneſſe: But rather thinke thus, if it be ſo joyfull a meſſage to heare of a pardon, how much better were it, to ſue it out, and apply it to my ſelfe? and how wofully ſhould it ſting me, if any things ſhould come betweene cup and lip, to defeat me of it? Remember, that all preparations of grace ſerve onely to teſtifie to the ſoule, that the Lord hath beene at worke, not that it ſhould reſt in a taſte of abſent, but preſſe on with unwearied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to obtaine the fulneſſe of a preſent and enjoyed happineſſe, and betruſt it ſelfe wholly to his workemanſhip, who would never have begunne, if it had not beene in his power and will to finiſh. Stand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at his curteſie wholly, as diſabled in thy ſelfe to cooperate with him, much leſſe to have him at the bent of thy bow: binde Selfe to the altar with cordes, and turne thy active medling ſpirit, into a meere paſſive and waiting ſpirit upon the worke of God; not as a ſlave, nor as a loyterer, but as a ſelf-denyer, and one whoſe ſtrength is to ſit ſtill, and behold the ſalvation of God. Oh (beloved!) that I could ſo follow this councell of mine with effectuall prayer to the Lord, that through mercy it might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a mean to put to an happy end thoſe endleſſe &amp; innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of ſtaggering conſciences, &amp; to ſettle them in ſome tolerable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, with comfort and quietneſſe: And ſo much may alſo ſerve for this third and laſt Branch of inſtruction.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, the Spirit of God under conſtant meanes workes leaſurely: and therefore corruption is not caſt out all at once, but by long diſcipline and diſcovery of it, by the word: and in the multitude of helpes (ſuch as <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label> God be thanked) have beene enjoyed in ſundry places, much rankeneſſe hath growne (as a canker in a faire apple) in the ſpirits of many Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, as pride, ſelfe-conceit and prejudice; which the Lord hath juſtly puniſhed (as I noted in the reaſons) with a ſpirit of fulſomeneſſe and furfet, hardneſſe of heart, and difficulty of perſwaſion; ſo that in theſe daies, that old tenderneſſe and ſelfe-deniall which poſſeſſed the ſpirits of moſt Chriſtians, is rare to finde.<note place="margin">Much need therefore of urging this doctrine in theſe our daies.</note> Much more need therefore there is of this doctrine to be urged in theſe dayes; that ſuch as are the Lords, and yet held under this ſnare may be pulled out and ſaved, and thoſe who are not, may be left therein, becauſe they would not receive the truth in the naked love of it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, to end this uſe, this I adde, That although the Lord ſhould <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>4</label> have called home many, without any former knowledge of Selfe, in any great meaſure: yet I doubt not, but when they do come to a better view of it, they will both mend their former bottomes, ſee cauſe to truſt God and glorifie his grace in Chriſt more then ever before; and alſo looke to themſelves in the courſe of their ſanctification the more watchfully, leſt this enemy ſhould hurt them more in that, then it did in the matter of their firſt converſion. However I ſee no cauſe, why the more cleare diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the will and way of God, ſhould ſeeme ſuperfluous; becauſe God had his number, when the light ſhined not ſo cleerly. And ſo much for anſwer to this queſtion. We may diſcover it by theſe marks. Firſt, by the true humbling of the ſoule. A proud heart will have her will to die for it: Becauſe pride hath high thoughts and muſt be ſatisfied, as <hi>Rabel</hi> with children, or elſe ſhee dies. And her daughters having loſt their children by <hi>Herods</hi> ſword, would not be ſatisfied, becauſe they were not. See an example in thoſe fugitives, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 43. They would go into Egypt or elſe all is marred. But the humble, lowly heart, is glad to ſtoop to any conditions. The former is a dogged, ſtout, invincible heart. The other is a broken and yeelding one; it will indure any tearmes of ſelfe-deniall to abaſe it ſelfe. Will God have him poore, in meane account, ſuffer loſſe of goods, liberties for him? He is content, laies hand upon his mouth: not a word my ſoule, God will have it thus. Will God have <hi>Paul</hi> preach? He ſtoops to it. Will he have him not preach in Bythinia, but in Macedonia? He deſcants not. Will he have him goe from prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to priſon, to baniſhment, to the ſword? He is content: If <hi>Michel</hi> mocke <hi>David,</hi> he will yet be more wiſe: If <hi>Sheme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> will curſe him, hee will not revenge: If he muſt loſe his Kingdome, let the Lord doe with him as he will.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Triall, Judge thy ſelfe not in coole bloud, but when thou art put to it: Then Self will moſt recoile, and ſelfe-deniall will moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peare. Then is a ſouldier tried for courage, when his enemy is upon
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:45715:99"/> him, as <hi>Sampſon.</hi> When temptation is abſent, a foole is wiſe, a froward one is patient, an unchaſte one is chaſte. But trie him and hee will act himſelfe, and ſhew his mettall: In a good and peaceable time, it is little to be good, but to be ſo where Satans throne is, is ſomewhat: in the midſt of an adulterous generation to ſhine, is ſome ſigne of ſelfe-deniall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, trie thy ſelfe-deniall, by thy forſaking of gainefull ſinnes. <hi>Saul</hi> will kill the refuſe of <hi>Amalek,</hi> but the King and the fat cattell and the beſt of jewells he will ſave. <hi>David</hi> will not kill <hi>Saul,</hi> to haſten a Kingdome. When two plead at the ſoules barre, gaine and conſcience, only then is thy ſelfe-deniall ſearched. Then looke to thy tacklings. When Selfe is not importunate, one Selfe may croſſe another. But if in importunity, the ſoule be rough and reſiſt, it is a ſigne of denying her ſelfe. Obſerve narrowly on whoſe ſide thou giveſt ſentence, when Chriſt and Luſt pleade together, as the two harlots. If the ſword of the word decide, all is well. If <hi>Abraham</hi> will renounce himſelfe in his dear affection to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> God may truſt him for ever.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Try thy ſelfe in point of free willingneſſe to ſearch out the expreſſe will of God in a caſe of doubt; without ſhuffling and crooking the rule of God to thine owne bent. Thus did <hi>Balaam</hi> coſen himſelfe with his conſulting with God, and ſpeaking againſt an houſe full of gold, but taking an handfull and going with the meſſengers; hee had light at a key hole to tell him he muſt not go, yet he quaſht it. <hi>Iohanan</hi> &amp; his men prayed <hi>Ieremy</hi> to conſult with God: but ſtill hoping they ſhould have a grant, but being told he refuſed. There is no halting before the Creeple: The Lord knowes the meaning of the Spirit. There is a light in the minde, but the inſpiring, the ſtraitning of it is from God. Good wares will abide the light; Bad will not: And truth ſeekes no corners: But Selfe doth; and will ſay, I would not put my mony to uſe; but that it is againſt a Common-wealth to keepe it. I would bee ſtrict in a Sabbath, but that it is too Jewiſh: ſuch figleaves our nakedneſſe will ſow together. So much for this.</p>
               <p>Againe, let this doctrine of Selfe, teach us wiſely to trie our ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the truth of it, as well as our juſtification, and the effectualneſſe thereof. Selfe remaines in the beſt to defile their holieſt endeavours in part: But in hypocrites it defiles both perſons and actions wholly. So that it ſhould make us wary how farre we aſcribe to our ſanctification, except wee can prove our principle to be ſound. Selfe will deceive us with falſe colours of holineſſe, if we be not wary; for there bee many things which carry a ſtrong ſhew of it, and yet come from a falſe ground: All is not gold that gliſters: diſtinguiſh therefore our ſanctification, from all falſe principles which doe make ſemblance of it to deceive others and eſpecially our ſelves. An eaſie thing it is, (as I once read in a godly mans writings) for an erroneous heart, to goe forth in the ſtrength of falſe principles of Selfe, aſſiſted with education, Selfe in naturall parts, Selfe in luſts, Selfe in the power of Ordinances or Evangelicall light, Selfe cuſtomes with many ſuch like as theſe, Selfe feare and bondage examples. To give a little taſte of a few of theſe, that by the paw wee may judge of the Lion, and perceive how farre ſanctification lies above Selfe. Firſt take naturall Selfe to taske, both in her affections, abilities
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:45715:99"/> and conſcience. Naturall affections may deceive thus, <hi>Abraham</hi> would needs have <hi>Iſmael</hi> live in Gods ſight out of a naturall affection, <hi>Iſaac</hi> would have <hi>Eſau</hi> enjoy the bleſſing againſt the promiſe. A woman hath a ſicke child which ſhee earneſtly deſires to live, and goes to God for it, though without faith, being a naturall woman. Chriſt is not the ſtrength of the prayer, but nature. See <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. Affections are good, (as we ſee in <hi>Hanna</hi>) if under faith. But this error is thus diſcovered: when the object is ſpirituall, and the motive ſpirituall, the affection is ſound; but when the ſoule is not carried beyond a naturall object, (as when a woman having her child recovered, prayes no more) it is a ſigne of meere nature, See <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.24. in the Shechemites. Againe, when naturall affections onely carry the ſoule, then meere ſoftneſſe of nature acts a man, but not tenderneſſe of heart: ſoftneſſe of nature will yeeld both wayes; it will pitty an offender being puniſht, as well as an innocent, it will be curteous to all ſorts alike, without reſpect of grace or deſert: why? Becauſe it is onely generall, nature proceeding alway one way. Softneſſe will yeeld in the Church to counſell, and out of the Church to ill company. But <hi>Ioſias</hi> his tenderneſſe yeelded but one way, that is to the Law of God; but was oppoſite to Idolls, and deſtroyed them. Mourning women hired at funeralls, or ſtageplayers weepe for good and bad. <hi>Ieremy</hi> weepes for <hi>Ioſia,</hi> the breath of their noſtrills, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. and for the Church <hi>Ierem.</hi> 9.1. So much for this.</p>
               <p>The like I ſay of naturall abilities; They oft come in the roome of Chriſt and Grace: The lackey rides, and the Prince goes on foote. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Abilities, are wit, expreſſions, memory, judiciouſneſſe and the like; in prayer, conference, repetitions of Sermons &amp;c. But the error is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned thus: Abilities doe not humble or change the ſoule, as true ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification doth, but puffes up the heart rather; Grace with giftes, aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the ſoule. See for this <hi>Acts</hi> 3.12. <hi>Revel.</hi> 9.10.21. Faith the nearer it comes to God, the humbler it makes a man; it is an emptying grace of Selfe. Againe, parts will not keepe a man from ſinne as grace will. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities will not reach to ſuffer for God, though they ſeeme to act for him, if ſuffering come, Selfe rages. But Grace goes forth in Gods ſtrength, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.5.6. They went through Baca,<note place="margin">Pſal. 84.</note> yet from ſtrength to ſtrength. Love is wanting to only-Abilities: Abilities only looke at themſelves, as their own excellency: but grace makes God her excellency: only a naturall man beholds the Miniſter in his parts, not his ſpiritualnes.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So I ſay touching naturall conſcience: <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14.15. The heathens by naturall conſcience, accuſed or excuſed themſelves. But this is eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, becauſe ſuch a conſcience acts a man onely in a naturall way: As they of Liſtra thinking the Apoſtles to be Gods, brought their Bulls to ſacrifice to them: many a drunkard taxes himſelfe, but his taxing is weak and vaniſhes; but a ſpirituall conſcience is firme and overpowring: Again, a naturall conſcience can be but morall at moſt, as not to lie, ſwear; but a ſpirituall embraces ſupernaturally revealed things, as faith, regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And put caſe ſuch a conſcience have ſome light of the word added to it, yet without grace by the word, corruption is not ſubdued, as it is in a man who lookes into the mirror of the word: See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. So much for theſe three Branches of Nature.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:45715:100"/>
               <p>The ſecond triall is of education: It is with many Chriſtians as with Empericks they have learned ſome receits from able Phyſitians, but want grounds of Art to miniſter phyſicke themſelves. So many have had good education with <hi>Ioaſh</hi> under <hi>Iehoiada,</hi> and act accordingly. But the diſcovery of theſe is, that they are ſoone weary of Gods worke (I ſay not onely in it, for ſo may a good man) but of it; becauſe their principle is outward: but the ſanctified ſoule being inwardly ſtirred from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is unwearied. See <hi>Eſay</hi> 30.31. They are carried in Gods armes. But the other walk as a creeple forced to goe by ſome externall mover: now forced motions cannot bee perpetuall, as the motion of legs ſtrengthened by ſinewes and joints. Againe, a man onely acted by edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, hath two motions, like the orbes of heaven, moved by their owne circular motion, and yet retrograded by the <hi>primum mobile:</hi> But a ſanctified motion is uniforme in it ſelfe; if he be in a good family, hee moves onely according to the good meanes thereof, not according to his corrupt motion. And when the party is furtheſt off his Parents or Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, the falſely principled, are moſt ſluggiſh and at laſt faint utterly: not ſo hee who is acted by grace; read <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 4.1. As the glaſſe which yeelds reflection, no longer then it is backed with ſteel. A ſtone will flie a while ſo long as the ſtrength of the arme abides in it, but no longer; becauſe it is acted contray to the principle. Examine thy ſelfe about this now; one day thou wilt elſe rue it: Beleeve not every ſhew. He whom Chriſt hath traind up, drinkes in his raine, his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is carried as I may ſay upon his ſhoulders, is cared for by him, bleſſed and upheld by him, though his naturall parts be never ſo weake, feeble and poore, whereas the counterfeit is abhorred by God, let his gifts and trainings be never ſo eminent. So much for this ſecond.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, again, a man may thinke himſelfe to go forth in the ſtrength of Grace, &amp; yet be meerly acted by ſome luſt; as <hi>Diogenes</hi> comming into <hi>Plato's</hi> houſe, and ſeeing coſtly ſilk cuſhions, trode upon them; ſaying, I trample upon <hi>Plato's</hi> pride. But <hi>Plato</hi> told him, he did ſo with a double pride: ſo <hi>Eſay</hi> 58. thoſe faſters went to work in the ſtrength of their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe and luſts. But an holy heart will make a naturall object, ſpirituall to it ſelfe: as a man may do evill in the ſtrength of a good intent (for lack of knowledge) ſo much more may a man doe good in the ſtrength of a luſt. How many will reprove others in the ſtrength of carnall indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the other Diſciples did thoſe two ſonnes of <hi>Zebedee?</hi> Or of a ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, froward, cenſorious humor? Luſt is contray to ſome luſt, grace only to all luſt: Some preached Chriſt out of envy, a good worke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from a luſt, but the diſcovery is eaſie; for ſuch a man obeyes not, becauſe he is commanded,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.6.</note> but for his will ſake. <hi>Object.</hi> But I do as I am commanded, therefore I am ſanctified. I anſwer if thou doſt ſimply ſo, it is well; elſe thou maieſt do a command, and yet uſe that as a colour to varniſh thy action, as a Apothecaries colour their phyſicke for a luſtre ſake, not to amend it. So a luſt may bee the principle, but yet a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand may be a ſtalking horſe. So much for this third.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, a man may coſen himſelfe about his obedience, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon power of the Goſpel, and the gifts which iſſue from thence; and yet come far ſhort of grace; as is manifeſt in <hi>Iudas, Alexander, Hymenaus,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:45715:100"/> Demas</hi> and others. And this is the ſubtileſt deluſion of all the former. As the lower element of water may ſymbolize with the higher of Aire, in an inferior quality of moiſtneſſe, though not of heate: ſo may an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite partake of the lower qualities of a beleever, but not of his grace. As the Maſter is, ſo is the ſcholar; if the Maſter can but read, the ſcholar can but read; but if hee be able to teach Grammer, then the ſcholar learnes that: So an ignorant man can read the booke of the creatures without, and the booke nature within; but an hypocrite can read the booke of the Goſpel, and yet may be farre from beleeving it. True it is, both naturall and divine gifts doe agree in ſome reſpects, as that both are infuſed, the one by nature, the other by grace: both leave ſome poſitive worke in the ſoule, but naturall gifts rather by ſubſtracting ſome evill: ſpirituall by adding ſome reall qualities: both give ſome liberty of working Godward; but the former give no freedome to the will in working, the latter doth; for whom the Sonne makes free, he is free indeed: <hi>Object.</hi> But by this it might ſeeme that the difference ſtands only in a degree? <hi>Anſw.</hi> True it is, there is a graduall difference between the good grounds, one brings forth thirty, another ſixty, a third an hundred fold: but the good and bad differ ſubſtantially: For meere common gifts of the Goſpel in hypocrites, firſt are inordinate; as <hi>Iudas</hi> ſeeing the box of ointment broken, thought of the poor, but inordinately; and <hi>Sauls</hi> ſaving the fat cattell of <hi>Amalek,</hi> was inordinate and irregular: So <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> and <hi>Saphira, Acts</hi> 5. Luſt muſt live, where it is not mortified, if not under open prophanneſſe, then under boord. Secondly, an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite may ſhunne a ſinfull luſt, by putting it aſide as when uncleanneſſe is juſtled aſide by ambition or covetouſneſſe; or an hypocrite may be for Chriſt in opinion, when the winde ſerves, but not when it turnes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a good heart is ſet that way, as the needle toucht, ſtands to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point: or thirdly, hypocrites may doe much by their conviction of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: but a beleever workes by the divine habit of grace put into and dwelling in his ſoule: moreover, true grace and morall differ in this, that the morall makes onely a change of accidents, as the fire makes iron hot and burning, but changeth not the iron from his nature: but grace changeth the whole nature alſo: for example, it doth not onely make a man pray, and be zealous, but it turnes his worldly froward heart, into an heavenly &amp; meek. Laſtly, know it by this, A true Chriſtian moves toward God with a moſt kindly and inward inſtinct of ſpirit, as the ſmoke moves upward and the ſtone downeward; an hypocrite moves by a forced motive of paſſion, feare or the like violence: life alway hath a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalneſſe of moving, as the ey-lid alway moves to keepe out duſt; ſo grace hath her inſtinct: The Law of God is written in his heart with the penne of a Diamond; therefore as onely nature teacheth Bees to flie home from a farre: ſo Grace ſends the ſoule to God in her revolts, armes it againſt enemies, ſuccours it in troubles, inclines it to good: But not ſo in the other; whence comes that deadneſſe, variableneſſe, dulneſſe, wearines, and other diſorder of ſpirit, in all unregenerate ones: Beloved, theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are weighty: lin not till you can truly trie your ſelves by them, that not Selfe but Sanctification is that true principle which workes in you. Do not as common folke in a crowd, who waite for the King, they think
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:45715:101"/> each Officer and Courtier is the King, but hee that knowes the King by face, will not be decieved by his followers. I deny not but all theſe particulars are good for followers, ſo the King be chiefe. All the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſilver are good which make up the ſumme, but yet come ſhort of good pay. Chriſt is the life of the ſoule, the treaſury of it, the ſtrength of it: The Angells could not foil Satan ſave by the ſtrength of the Lamb. Leane your ſelves, roll your ſelves upon him, as the Spouſe in the <hi>Cant.</hi> upon her beloved; and ſo you ſhall not be gulled in your obedience by any falſe principle of Selfe. And ſo much bee ſaid touching this laſt Branch of this maine and principall doctrine of ſelfe: one of the chiefe points intended in this my booke.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>5</label> The fifth and laſt uſe is Exhortation, and that in two reſpects: Firſt, to all ſuch as endeavour to bee converted to God:<note place="margin">Exhortation to two ſorts.</note> Thelatter to ſuch as are converted already. The former of theſe I chiefely aime at in the doctrine, (though the latter be a neceſſary conſequent upon the point, &amp; of great importance.<note place="margin">1. To ſuch as are yet to be converted.</note>) Firſt then for the former of theſe; and that ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of theſe two Branches: One is, that fithence this Selfe threatens the loſſe of ſo many mens endeavours for grace, therefore let all (who would ſave this loſſe, and hold that which they have gotten,) adde this one du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to deny themſelves, and forfeit this Selfe, which elſe will make them to forfeit heaven: empty thy ſoule of it and turne it up ſide downe, as one would doe a diſh which he would make cleane within and without. If any will be my Diſciple (ſaith our Lord Jeſus) let him caſt the hardeſt before hand,<note place="margin">Matth. 16.25.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Deniall of Selfe urged.</note> (and not the eaſieſt) let him deny himſefe: That which our Saviour there ſpake of one kinde of Selfe, wealth and welfare, health and life; that (in another kinde) I ſay of this Selfe, privy and inward, deny and abandon it, if thou meane to be Chriſts Diſciple. Let the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the Lord Jeſus to forgiveneſſe of life, make thee willing to part with and ſell all, which might hinder the bargaine. Men ſell bargaines for great ſummes of mony; the Lord ſells for no mony or price: Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver anſwers all things in common markets; but here it availes nothing: emptineſſe of Selfe, is that onely condition which the Lord lookes after: It is with this commodity as with the jewellers purchaſe of a pearle; It is worth all he hath, though he ſhould ſet all to ſaile which he could rappe and rend, his lands, leaſes, his monies, moveables, to the very cloathes off his backe, all too little to make a ſumme of ſufficient price. Now then marke: As it fares in the one with the jeweller, ſo it fares in the other with the ſoule. A foole that is but a common Goldſmith and wants deep skill, when hee meets with ſuch a choice pearle as cannot be bought without ſelling himſelfe out of all ſhop and plate and bables; ſhrugs at it, Oh! (ſaith he) though it is like, the pearle is ſomewhat worth, yet for me to put my ſelf out of ſtocke and cuſtome, and to ſell all my ware wherewith I was wont to make ſuch a faire ſhew to my chapmen, for a little thing which I may put in a box, and carry about me (without fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it) not knowing what I ſhall make of it, or how to put it off to my minde, what a foole were I to doe it! But when he hath refuſed the offer, then comes it to a wiſe Merchant of jewells, one that hath skill indeed in ſuch a pearle; what doth he? Conſiders it apart, duly weighes with
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:45715:101"/> himſelfe what it is worth, even Lordſhips and Manors, and a whole Towne of land and wealth: it is but the denying of his preſent humor, and the conveniences of a preſent dwelling, fine roomes, and a pretty ſeat, and contents, and perhaps ſome old gold and jewels, which his Anceſtors left him for a remembrance. The queſtion is not (with him) what it will coſt, but what it is worth, and what the regret of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken offer will be: money muſt bee had and paid preſently, the owner hath need of it, and will not forgoe ſuch a thing upon truſt. What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes upon this ſad demurre? Surely, rather then hee will reject the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, he will ſell all to his ſhirt, but he will have it.</p>
               <p>Here offers it ſelfe a fine Summer houſe, with Orchards and Gardens; there a delicate lot of ground, Medow or Paſture, and bids him, ſell not me. His brave walkes and ground next his dwelling, ſtep forth, ſaying, Sell not us, ſell thy out-lying peeces, ſuch as are no eye-ſore for thee to part with; but part not with that which as ſoone as thou ſteppeſt out of thy doore, thou goeſt into. What a narrowing and ſtraitning of thy ſelf were that? Then perhaps it comes to his minde, Oh! if I ſell off my livelihood, the world will count me a bankrupt, all will know what I ſell, but no body knowes what I have bought. And perhaps, ſome long kept Jewell will tempt him and ſay, How canſt thou part with me, which thou ſo oft joyeſt thy ſelfe in? So that here be lets on every ſide, and Selfe ſteppes in to marre all. But the skill of the Merchant over-powers all, hee tickles himſelfe with the thoughts of this Pearle, the leſſe it is known the more it is worth, and the greater is his vantage: and (all things conſidered) it is no great ſelfe-deniall to ſell all for ſo infinite a gaine, to loſe a preſent little for a future unknowne eſtate: therefore his eye will not ſpare, he will abondon all his worth, and gage his credit too, but hee will have it, and ſo he makes it his own. But having ſo done, will not take twice the worth of it again, Oh! do thou ſo (poor Soule) and proſper, ſell all, ſelfe and all: for though it be not worth in it ſelfe, the parings of thy nailes; yet becauſe opinion and errour, and a corrupt heart of ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, doe ſet ſuch a price upon it, he Lord is content to take it as a price of the Lord Jeſus. (As <hi>David</hi> thought a pot of water upon ſuch tearmes as the hazard of three Princes lives, a meet offering for God:) ſo I ſay, Offer God ſelfe and all, it is ſcarce worth a pot of water of it ſelfe, but as it is the price of life, ſo it makes the ſelfe-deniall pretious to God. Skin for skin, and all that a man hath, will hee give for life: but even this pretious life and all will a ſinfull ſoule give to ſave Selfe.</p>
               <p>Oh! what is every man ſave his minde?<note place="margin">Each mans will more deare to him then the world.</note> The minde of every man is the man: the ſpirit of the Miſer, the mind of the Drunkard, the conceit and opinion of a Papiſt, an Heretick or Schiſmaticke, the will of an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, (though all of them are as vile as dung) yet they are more pretious to them, then life it ſelfe! They will engage all, rather then their will and ſelfe. Even ſo fares it with corrupt ſelfe: The Lord offers to the ſoule, the Lord Jeſus, the fruit of his bloud and ſatisfaction, to pardon &amp; ſave it: But upon what tearmes? Surely theſe, that the ſoule ſell all: Alas! what is all ſhe hath to ſell, worth? Shee hath nothing but bare walls within, and a dung-hill without, he that ſhould carry them away to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:45715:102"/> have them, ſhould take them at a deare rate: for what is old <hi>Adams</hi> wealth, but miſery and nakedneſſe? Oh! but there is a further thing in it, the ſoule thinkes her ſelfe rich, and full. This conceit muſt be firſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred: the offer of Chriſt ſeemes to bee too hot and heavie: carnall wiſedome, reaſon, wit, eaſe, feare of loſing liberties and all other ſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts it: yea, ſhe ſo likes the Pearle, that ſhe will yeeld a devotion, a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of duties, of coſtly ſervice to redeeme this price of Selfe: the halfe of the Kingdome ſhe can forgoe, and the other halfe ſhee will yeeld to Chriſt, and ſo ſave her ſtake: but to ſell himſelfe wholly to the skin, that Chriſt may be all in all, ground, money, gold, apparell, meat, drinke, and all, this is death. But even this God muſt have, or nothing. For why? This will lay grace, and the thanke of the ſoule under feet: which God cannot endure; Therefore this price the Lord will have, or nothing. Oh! give it him freely: One peece of Selfe will plead, how canſt thou ſpare thy darling? Another, to live at eaſe in an opinion of a ſafe eſtate to God: How canſt thou part with it, being thy Idoll? thy boſome delight? But if thou be this merchant royall, who is able to weigh the worth of the Pearl offered thee, peace of conſcience, &amp; an happy death and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier life after; I adviſe thee put it not off for the ſake of a thouſand Selves, except thou will bring ſuch ſorrow upon thy ſelfe after, as all thy will cannot make recompence for, when the bargain is rejected. As the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in <hi>Ionah</hi> would have rowed to land to have ſaved <hi>Ionahs</hi> &amp; their own lives;<note place="margin">Jonah 1.</note> but when no way would ſerve, they threw all into ſea, Wheat and other proviſion. And when nothing would do, they caſt <hi>Ionah</hi> himſelfe in: ſo let this laſt enemy, Selfe (as perverſe as <hi>Ionah</hi> in his owne device) be throwne over-boord, rather then the pretious ſoule ſhould bee in jeopardy.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Miniſters muſt be the formoſt in ſelf deniall. Joſu. 3.15</note>And let us Miniſters of God (like the Prieſts that firſt ſtepped into Jordan when it gave way into Canaan) bee the firſt that tread out this way to the people of God: for it is a way, which though it bee troden out plainly enough in the Scriptures, yet had need of lively practice to teach it before men will beleeve it. Theſe ſheep are much led by the eye, as well as the eare, by beholding the examples of their Shepheards, I meane, as well as by doctrine. Oh! when they heare us declaim againſt Selfe, and plead for ſelfe-deniall very ſtoutly with our tongues; they lay their eare to our practice, and hearing our Lute ſtrings to jarre, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us wire-draw and caſt about every way, rather then we will part with any thing for peace of conſcience, or glory to God, not onely not our livings, but not our paſſions of wrath, envie, contention, vain-glory, not a braſſe farthing of our gaines, not a dramme of our pride, eaſe, idleneſſe, pompe and jollity, will and ſtomack, pleaſure or preferment for Chriſt and his Goſpel: they have the meaſure of our foot by and by, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to give us the hearing, till our tongues be torne; but till they ſee in us more ſelfe-deniall, they will never beleeve that wee ſpeake the truth for Gods cauſe, but onely as Parrets for faſhion ſake. Oh! the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite prejudice which we our ſelves (brethren) by our cloſe cleaving to our ſelves, have done to this great cauſe of God. And this I can ſay, That ſuch of Gods Miniſters as have hazarded themſelves moſt for God, and purchaſing advantage for their Miniſtery, have obtained more
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:45715:102"/> roome in the conſciences of their hearts, then many of ſuch as have ſtood out to the uttermoſt, and would not abate any ace of their owne, for the winning of reverence to their doctrine. And yet, I would alſo exhort Miniſters to be as inſtant in the teaching of this truth, as in lively exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying it in their practice. And rare it is to ſee it otherwiſe: that thoſe who have found by experience, the life of this truth of ſelfe-deniall in themſelves; can keepe hot coales in their boſomes, but muſt needs utter themſelves to their people in a ſerious and painfull preaching of this doctrine.</p>
               <p>There was a Statute we know of Mortmaine,<note place="margin">The true Mort-maine.</note> which was faine to bee enacted ſince the times of ſuperſtition in this our Kingdome, to cut off the validity of ſuch gifts as were given to the Clergy for Popiſh ends. This Statute ſhould every good Miniſter enact in his owne ſoule (if ever he looke to doe good to others) firſt to cut off, and make Selfe a Mort-maine, a dead hand (for God doth ſo) if it ſhall dare to bring any gifts to God for Chriſt, and to count them as abſolute forfeits, as if a Popiſh fellow ſhould give moneyes and yearly gifts to a Prieſt to read Maſſe or Dirigies for the weale of his ſoule after his deceaſe. And ſo the people, let them bee exhorted alſo to exalt free grace, and meere Chriſt in the promiſe, not muttering that they find not that fruit of their ſelfe-deniall, that they expect: but counting it their chiefe work to wait at the poſts of grace (not as fooliſh pilgrimes doe, at the gate of the Popes entrance, knocking with a golden hammer, till he bring them his Jubilee bleſſing: but with patience attending the promiſe, till the Lord ſhall ſtirre the dead poole of their hearts, and quicken them with hope, confeſſing that it is mercy they may live and breathe in Gods aire, much more by the aire of a promiſe: (although not yet ſo eſtabliſhed in their hearts as they could deſire; yet ſufficient to keep them from grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to make them lay their hand upon their mouth, and to bee dumb,<note place="margin">Malac. 3.</note> till the Lord bring healing in his wings, and put an end to their waiting. But as for eſteeming themſelves for their common gifts of knowledge or zeale, to be ever the neerer to God for which thouſands are in hell) abhorring it, and chuſing to be the pooreſt doore-keeper in Gods houſe, then the higheſt Phariſees in the Church, who need no righteouſneſſe of another, becauſe they boaſt of their owne.</p>
               <p>Therfore in all matters of God deny thy ſelf, &amp; cleave to God. God is the firſt cauſe, and therefore the true end of our being, actions, ſervice. All Rivers runne into the Sea. For us to make our ſelves our owne ends, were to make our ſelves God, independent, and to make God an Idoll. To deny our ſelves is to diſtinguiſh our ſelves from the ungodly, who make themſelves and the creature their happineſſe. Wee looke to better our ſelves by our ſelfe-love, but indeed we deſtroy our ſelves: Selfe is our diſeaſe: ſelfe-deniall is our cure. Whether is it better for us to yeeld to? but we infinitely better our ſelves by denying our ſelves, even an hundred fold as Chriſt tells us. <hi>Object.</hi> But who ever hated his owne fleſh? Doth not God himſelfe perſwade us by ſelfe-loving arguments? As by profit, pleaſure, peace? I anſwer, yes, Selfe is a plant of Gods planting in our nature. But it is one thing to deſtroy an horſes good mettall, another to rectifie and ſubdue it; ſo it is one thing to deſtroy
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:45715:103"/> Selfe, and affections (with Stoicks) another to regulate and direct them: Love thy ſelfe and ſpare not; ſo the Lord by his word may order thee in it, and take off thine exorbitant Selfe, as in the love of thy wife, ſeeking of learning, wealth, honour, favour, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For the better perſwading of thee hereto take ſome motives and ſome meanes. Firſt, for motives. Till Selfe be denied, thou doſt in vaine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe to be religious: thou oppoſeſt a deſire of thine owne againſt an whole body of death; for Selfe is overſpread in all the lims and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thy body and ſoule, as the forme is over the matter, and the Call over the inwards. Thou wilt be tried with ſelfe reſiſtance, except the principle be firſt removed: Fleſh will ſo dog thee with her askings, that thou wilt be weary with refuſings. Till the ſoule be thus prepared, there can be nothing done: The firſt husband muſt be dead, ere thou canſt marry a new; at leaſt in the rectified intention and preparation of thy ſoule. The fleſh of the Virgin had beene a clogge to the ſecond perſon, except firſt ſeparated and purified by the holy Ghoſt. Elſe <hi>Demas</hi> might have clave to <hi>Paul</hi> as well as <hi>Silas;</hi> the ten ſpies to God as well as <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioſue.</hi> But they were of two ſpirits. No agreement betweene two croſſe principles.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God will never ſtoope to thee, his will is not to be bowed to thine, nor ever will while the world ſtandeth. For his will is the rule, thine the ſtring out of tune: What ſhould order a crooked thing, but a ſtreight? Neither can they both ſtand together: take whether you will, both you cannot have; you cannot have your will and ſwinge in your contents of world, luſt and liberties, and Chriſt too; no man can ſerve two Maſters, nor drive two ſuch trades at once, as a Fullers and a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers; the one ſullyes as faſt as the other whitens: nay, of the two, there is more to be made of following Selfe alone without Chriſt, then Selfe and Chriſt: by the former a man may at leaſt get himſelfe a worldly happineſſe, though he loſe heaven after. But by the latter, a man makes him wretched and diſtracted, ſo that he can neither enjoy the one, nor the other. Skin for skin and all that a man hath he will give for his life. The heart of a Chriſtian is ſingle in reſpect of his object, onely God and his favour no mixtures with it. Either deny nature in her inordinateneſſe or elſe give God over, for both cannot conſent in one degree of eminency; who cares for a wavering minded man, either to make him our chapman or friend or husband? For ſtill hee ſeekes not us, but himſelfe: Let no ſweet morſell be kept in our palate, to cauſe God to be out of relliſh with us. Better key-cold, then lukewarme.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is equall that Chriſt and God be chiefe, becauſe they have bought us with a price, to bee theirs. Wee ſhould doe him great wrong who hath bought a Captive, if hee ſhould doe his owne worke. God hath not onely bought our ſervice but our ſelves. Except then wee never made ſuch a bargaine with God, wee muſt bee for him, who hath ſo dearly bought us. To be ſure, God will bee revenged of us as well for not making that bargaine, as for not keeping it. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. Some hypocrites are ſaid to deny Chriſt who bought them. A ſervant is his Maſters mony.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The ſoule feeles a heaven in ſelfe-deniall. What inward
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:45715:103"/> content (thinke we) had <hi>Abraham</hi> when he had denied <hi>Iſaacs</hi> life? And <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> when they could preferre God and his Church, before their ſalvation; to ſuffer afflictions with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> rather then to be a Prince in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court. Contrariewiſe, what an hell carrieth that man in his ſoule, who for baſe ends, denies God and conſcience? Let but a man deny one baſe luſt of revenge, wrath, and what an heavenly heart doth he carry with him to prayer.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Think what an emptineſſe there is in thy ſelf, thine own aimes and bents of heart, and in thoſe creatures and objects which thou judgeſt ſo ſweet: Wells wanting water and cloulds without raine. As one ſaith of the Pagan Gods, why did men chuſe ſo many ſave that each one was emptineſſe? When the eie of Selfe falls downe from one cleere Sunne, it thinkes it ſees three or foure, but they are all but fancies. The fulleſt creature is but a brittle glaſſe full of water; give it but as a cracke and it is gone. If we were convinced hereof, who would ſeeke vanity? Who would deceive himſelfe in eating aſhes, <hi>Eſay</hi> 44. and hold a lie in his right hand? It is meere inconſiderateneſſe, and want of weighing things, as hee ſaith there of the Idolater.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Either be armed ſtrongly to deny thy ſelfe, or elſe thou art foiled. For Selfe is as the wife in the boſome. It is hard to deny a friend a neighbour, (eſpecially if importunate, as him in the Goſpel, who came by night for loaves) how much leſſe a wife? Nay Selfe is yet neerer unto us then a wife: It comes alway with a bribe, a gift in the hand, ſweetneſſe of luſt, is as butter in a Lordly diſh: This bribe unhappily proſpers whereſoever it goes; except thou deale harſhly with it, as hee with <hi>Iehorams</hi> meſſenger it will prevaile. Stoppe thine eares as the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. In vaine is the net laid for that which hath wing. Dally not with her, as <hi>Eve</hi> with the ſerpent, <hi>Sampſon</hi> with <hi>Delila.</hi> If ſhe fell in innocency, how wilt thou ſtand in corruption? Peremptory folke are beſt in a good cauſe; and ſhe is the moſt chaſte wife, who hath the moſt denying behaviour.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, There is enough in God to make amends for denying Selfe. That which Selfe falſly promiſeth, God both juſtly and duly promiſeth and peformeth. To joyne any thing with God is to joyne a candle to the Sunne, or water to the Ocean. And (as hath beene ſaid) it is the way to make us hated of God and men: of God for lacke of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, of men for lacke of wickedneſſe. In things confuſed no man knows his owne. To expect reward from two Maſters, is to loſe our labour from both. So much be ſaid for motives.</p>
               <p>To adde ſome meanes of getting ſelfe-deniall. Firſt then, labour to make ſomewhat elſe thy ſelfe, beſide thy ſelfe; elſe thou wilt never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thy ſelfe: For Selfe cannot oppoſe Selfe, in the particular of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no more then Satan can Satan. If once grace come in place and ſtead of Selfe, then all old Selfe, life and the comforts of it, ſhall go for new Selfe; elſe God and all ſhall goe for houſe and land, favour of men and liberties, luſts and will of the fleſh. So <hi>Paul</hi> calleth grace himſelfe: It is not I, but ſinne in mee; <hi>q. d.</hi> a ſtranger, an excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No matter what become of fleſh, if ſpirit once bee Selfe. Get this ſound judgement, what deſerveth to bee Selfe, and all is well: the old houſe ſhall downe, that a new may bee ſet up.</p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:45715:104"/>
               <p>Secondly, be armed with ſound reſolution againſt the ſtrong error of the world, which maintaines godlineſſe to be meere loſſe. True it is that perſecutions follow Chriſtianity; howbeit even with ſuch perſecutions &amp; afflictions,<note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k. 10.</note> a Chriſtian ſhall have an hundred fold. As God can fill the ſoul with bitterneſſe in abundance; ſo can he fill with joy and comfort, an heart which wants, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 1. When my afflictions abounded, then did my conſolations abound alſo. As a man may be in Paradiſe accurſed, ſo in priſon an happy man. <hi>Ruben</hi> what got hee in defiling of <hi>Bilha?</hi> Surely ſhame, he loſt both birthright to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> Kingdome to <hi>Iuda,</hi> and Prieſthood to <hi>Levi:</hi> Hee was ſtrength and excelleny, but loſt all. And what got <hi>Salomon</hi> by denying himſelfe in his petition? Both that he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and that which he asked not.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider what ever it be which thou ſeekeſt without God, cannot doe thee any good. When God bids honour, wealth, any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do thee good it ſhall, elſe not: They are inſtruments, and workes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the agent, as the ſaw by the hand of the mover. They comfort us onely by a borrowed comfort. And ſo on the other ſide, nothing can hurt, no not <hi>Shemei,</hi> except God bid him; and when the curſe is gone forth, yet it ſhall be both cauſeleſſe and fruitleſſe, except God ſend it. Thoſe that do ſo Idolize the creature, yet finde it oft, their ſnare; yea the favour of Princes, proves their ſnare, and ſo they are forced to ſay, If God had beene chiefe, this or that had not been.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſtirre up ſundry graces of God in thy ſoule: Firſt, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; ſecondly, faith; thirdly, the love of God. For the firſt, conſider God in his worth. We uſe to ſay, Let ſuch a friend ſpeed, he is worthy; only knowing of God and his gift will make him prized, and Selfe deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. See Pſal. 73.20. They that know thee ſhall love thee. 1 Cor. 1.12.13. See the place. Secondly, faith: ſee that catalogue of ſelfe-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Saints, who refuſed to enjoy pleaſures in <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Court, endured the ſpoyling of goods, &amp;c. How came they by this? By faith they did it: Faith Conquers Selfe by the ſame power whereby ſhee overcomes the world; for the world within is the chiefe world. See 1 Tim. 4.10. Thirdly, love: When <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo diſſwaded from Suffering, hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, What doe you rending my heart thus? I am ready to goe and to ſuffer loſſe of all for Chriſt: all is dung and droſſe to him. The love of Chriſt compells us; the Greek word is, hemmes us in as in a pinfold, that we can goe no way out of it, 1 Cor. 13. Love is bountifull, ſhe ſeeks not her owne, but Chriſts: ſhe ſuffers all things, endures all things. And to theſe adde, Stirre up wiſedome, and be able to conclude, that in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy ſelfe, is true ſafety, peace, gaine: in the contrary is nothing but ſorrow, repentance: if not here, yet in a ſeaſon unwelcome. See Matth. 16. end: viz. when Chriſt ſhall come with his Angels. Selfe ſhall prove thy plague, thy bane, if thou yeeld to it, as <hi>Amnon</hi> to <hi>Tamar,</hi> there will be no end of yeelding.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Branch of Exhortation. Get the Spirit of grace.</note>The ſecond branch of exhortation is this, Labour to get that Spirit of grace which God hath annexed to his covenant and promiſe, that it may not bee naked and empty, but accompanied and mixed with efficacie and power in the hearts of the hearers. This Spirit oppoſeth Selfe in all the elect, and ſuffereth it not to make the word to goe without effect, and to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:45715:104"/> defeat them of their hope. It is ſuch a ſpirit in the ſoul as taketh them off from their owne ſpirit of Selfe, preſents ſo really the good things which God hath given us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.</note> that it cauſes the ſoule willingly to relinquiſh all home contents, and (with <hi>Caleb</hi> Numb. 14.) to turne the greateſt yron charets, Anakims and difficulties of beleeving, into encouragements and perſwaſions. I might (ſave for envie) compare it with the ſpirit of <hi>New England</hi> (not that all who goe that voyage deny themſelves; for among many that doe, ſome ſeek themſelves) but I ſay, to the ſpirit of ſuch as goe thither.

But the true ſight of Grace, throwes Selfe out of her owne poſſeſſion and ends: The fulneſſe of Grace empties the ſoule to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. Aske thy ſelfe then; hath the view of this Grace and of the truth as it is in Jeſus, emptied thee of all thy gifts, duties and religious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances? Then it is a true Spirit and deſtroies Selfe. There is no true godly Spirit, but it is the more humble, lowly and vile in its owne eies by Grace. Selfe gathers falſe courage to her ſelfe by the Grace which is offered, growes conceited, confident and full of her ſelfe; ſhe thinks ſhe cannot want enough of it; whereas all runnes over and leaves her barren. The ſpirit of Grace, ſo ſhewes the fulneſſe of Grace, that it exhauſtes her owne fulneſſe wholly, as thoſe ſterven Egyptians beholding <hi>Ioſephs</hi> ſtore of corne, were more abaſed for their beggery; and the Queene of Sheba beholding the depth of <hi>Salmons</hi> wiſedome, became a foole, all her owne ſpirit of queſtioning and cavilling ſunke downe.

As when a proud boy heares a good ſcholar talke, his conceit of himſelfe turnes to abaſement; Oh, how his combe is cut! what a fool and an idot he is in his own eies! If the Grace ye ſeek doth humble ye, and not puffe ye up, it is as it ſhould be; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe (brethren) it would make one tremble to thinke how little of this Spirit is ſtirring in the world; I ſee but few poore ones among us, by this plenty of the Goſpel; take heed the Lord let us not bloud of this

Grace in a poore ſoule, is as the power of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is to the inferior faculties; when once the ſoule is infuſed into the Infant, this ſupreame one of Reaſon ſubordaines the other faculties of vegetation and ſenſe to her ſelfe; all come under her authority and name: Looke whatſoever Selfe hath formerly aimed at above Grace, the Spirit fetches it all under it ſelfe. As <hi>Peters</hi> trade of fiſhing, and nets were vile in his eies, when hee ſaw the glory of Chriſt upon mount Thabor. Even all Selfe and folly comes behinde the Spirit of Grace. Oh! what a bleſſed liberty is this, to bee rid of the bondage of Selfe! what cauſe of rejoycing! Oh (brethren!) to love the Lord Jeſus for himſelfe, and all other things for his ſake, what a checke is it to Selfe? Good brethren note it, and trie your ſelves by it; if thoſe contents which were unlawfull, be cut off wholly, and the lawfull ſeaſoned and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Chriſt, if thoſe delights which formerly were either ſavored for themſelves or without Chriſt: now we cannot reliſh, but in and through Chriſt. it is ſome ſigne that Selfe is brought under the ſubjection of the Spirit of Grace. And to this may be added, which differs not much in ſubſtance) that the truth as it is in Jeſus and the Spirit of Grace, is the ſupply and furniture of the ſoule in all the wants and difficulties of it, ſo that it need take no further thought, it takes off the ſoule from all thoſe proppes which ſhee formerly truſted unto, and makes a rich ſupply of them in Chriſt really. Excellent is that ſpeech which <hi>Ioſeph</hi> bid his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren utter to <hi>Iacob</hi> when he ſent for him into Egypt: Take no thought (ſaith he) for your houſhold ſtuffe and implements which ye uſe; for lo, all the fulneſſe of the land of Egypt is before you count all your furniture not worth the carrying,<note place="margin">Gen. 45.20.</note> for ye ſhall find in Egypt ſuch ſtore of all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that you ſhall not repent you of the leaving of them behinde. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the promiſe of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> were ſo well worth the truſting to, what is the promiſe of Chriſt worth? And if the ſtore of Canaan were ſo ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Egypt, what is the ſupply of Selfe worth to one that is in Chriſt?
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:45715:106"/> If this were thought of beforehand, how lythe and cheerfull would the ſoule be in going to Zoar out of Sodome? How farre would ſhee be from looking backe with <hi>Lots</hi> wife, as loth to depart from her old trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? The heart called to Chriſt, hankers and hangs off, here catching up one rag of Selfe, there another, loath to goe naked, fearing leſt there ſhould not be enough for all uſes and turnes in Chriſt; but when ſhee heares, Take no thought for any of theſe, Chriſt ſhall afford all meet eaſe, credit, content and worldly conveniency: Oh it is well content to leave it for who ſo will: let them take it that know no Chriſt. As the lame man hearing Chriſt calling him, threw away his cloke and crutches, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, If Chriſt will give me my limbs, I take no thought for theſe, either I ſhall need none, or have them better ſupplied from a fountaine.</p>
               <p>Brethren, weigh this marke well. Selfe cannot digeſt it. All the whole ſea of Chriſt is no content to her, except ſhee can eike him out with ſomewhat of her owne: ſhe hangs in the aire without a bottome, like a ſtone, till it be upon her center. But Chriſt is a ſufficient ſtore to a poore ſoule in the vacuity of other things. Though there were no calfe in the ſtall or bullock in the flock,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.</note> yet Chriſt were enough. Trie your ſelves: you may as eaſily judge by this marke, as what meate your ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack ſtands to. If onely you can bee ſatisfied with Chriſt, while your eaſe, credit, health and welfare laſt, then (upon point) Chriſt is not theſe, but theſe are Chriſt. When <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaw the charets, he had enough; if you cannot ſay ſo, when you behold the promiſe, all is not well: Onely an inſufficient Chriſt cauſeth ſuch patching. A good new garment needs no ſhreds to peece it; Chriſt is to a poore child of God (as <hi>Elkana</hi> told diſcontented <hi>Hanna</hi>) more then tenne ſonnes.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.</note> Till there be enough felt and taſted in Chriſt, who will forgoe his other proppes? Who will flit out of his dwelling, to lie in the ſtreet? The true mother cried, let her have all the child, rather then divide it. So the ſoule that is guided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,<note place="margin">1 King. 3.</note> loathes to divide Chriſt; he had as leave have none. Beg of the Lord to reach you out the Lord Jeſus in his full ſupply of all wants, and ſeaſoning of all mercies, that your ſoule having this boote in beame, may be indifferent for other things, as knowing they ſhall either not bee needed, or elſe caſt in.</p>
               <p>The third branch of the Spirit of grace in oppoſing Selfe, is, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing and ſubjecting of the ſoule with equalneſſe and contentedneſſe of minde to all thoſe termes and conditions upon which grace may bee obtained;<note place="margin">The third Marke. It ſubjects the ſoule to Chriſt, upon his owne tearmes and conditions.</note> refuſing no difficulties, neither uſe of meanes, nor forſaking her old contents, but thinking grace a rich pennyworth, whatſoever ſhe coſt. There is a baſeneſſe and cloſeneſſe in Selfe, whereby ſhe cauſeth the ſoul to ſhrug at the conditions of Grace, as weariſome and coſtly: this humor the Spirit of Grace removes &amp; cauſes ſuch a cheerfull willingnes in the ſoule to ſtoop to any tearms of Gods impoſing, that ſhe thinkes her ſelfe well, if ſhe may ſo ſpeed. When a man lies ſicke of a diſeaſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of death, he will ſend his ſtate to the Phyſitian, and give him a ſlight fee, but he is loath to charge himſelfe deeply for the matter: but if ſickneſſe encreaſe, and danger of life appeare, then the deſire after health, and the fear of danger concurring, make him devoure all charges, then he will have the Phyſitian come to him, and give him any recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:45715:106"/> being glad of health upon any conditions. So it is here. Coy and queazie Selfe, that feeles no danger, and reaches at Grace as a good thing in generall, can beteame no great paines, nor deny her ſelfe any wonted liberty, nor ſubmit to any great abaſement of her ſelfe for the matter; if it come eaſily, ſhe is content. But if once the Spirit of Grace ſhew her the danger of forgoing it, of delaying to get if, of an indifferent, remiſſe heart, lazy, carnall, and willing to goe to heaven with all her will and liberties; if once ſhe preſent the neceſſity of it, and the true ſenſe of utter periſhing without it, lo then, the caſe is altered,<note place="margin">John 10.10.</note> then (as <hi>Peter</hi> on the ſuddaine would have Chriſt waſh him throughout) ſo ſhe growes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute to beare downe all ſelfe, lets, diſſwaſives, feares, loſſes, diſcredit; then (ſo ſhe may have Grace) ſhee will have it any way; let all goe ſhee cares not, ſo ſhe may enjoy that pretious thing ſhe loveth: ſhe tramples upon her pride, eaſe and all that hangeth on as a clog without, or as a let within, glad, if with the forfeit of all, ſhe can purchaſe it.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.1.</note> Marke this (good brethren) let the Spirit of Grace prevaile a little, and it is ſtrange how it ſubdues that loathneſſe of Selfe to yeeld, the rebellion and fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Spirit! Oh! it cauſes the Lion and Lambe to feed together, it tames the ſoule and carries it captive, bound hands and feete, content to abaſe it ſelfe to the loweſt and pooreſt tearmes, to be taught and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the way of God, by the moſt deſpiſed inſtruments, which before ſhe diſdained to learne of. Curioſity now, and choice of Preachers, and accepting of the Grace of our Lord Jeſus, in reſpect of perſons, is baſe and unſavoury. Now ſhee ſees Grace is onely in the hand of God to give or reſtraine, now it is a dainty commodity indeed, and beares prick and priſe in the ſoule; any thing will be given for it, if God will now ſell it her, let him but aske and have, and whatſoever before was in high eſteeme, ſhall now be vile, and as dung unto it! Oh! (beloved) trie your ſelves alſo by this marke, and if ye finde the leaſt dramme of this geaſon worke of the Spirit in you, dampe it not nor quench it, leſt Selfe returne and ſet ſuch a deepe price upon it, that perhaps yee will never recover it againe. If a ſpirit of frequent and unwearied hearing, travell, confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, meditation, queſtioning, conſulting with ſuch as can reſolve us, a ſpirit of wiſdome to devoure ſinfull baſhfulneſſe and modeſty, and coynes in revealing our doubts, be given unto us: if wee feele an heart in us loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that lither, liſtleſſe, dead ſpirit which was wont to withdraw us, beware we loſe it not, nouriſh it, and although all the world ſhould mock us, and our own baſe ſpirit ſhould tell us we ſhall be noted for our labour, let us make never the leſſe of it, nor be diſcouraged.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Marke. Spirit of Grace reſiſts thoſe ſpeciall pangs of ſelfe, in every ſoule.</note> the Spirit of Grace reſiſts thoſe particular and perſonall pangs of Selfe &amp; ſelf-love, which the ſoul eſpecially is diſtempered with: Selfe is a ſtock of many branches, even originall antipathy to Chriſt and Grace at every rate; but ſome appeare in one, ſome in another: as in the body ſome humors ſettle within the intralls, others breake out into ſores and ſwellings. So here: In ſome there appeares a baſe lither heart, in ſome a ſpirit of the world, luſting to rake and ſcrape, in others ſubtilty and hollowneſſe to colour over their owne corruption, in ſome a barren deadneſſe of heart, in others ſecret pride and reſting in their gifts, in ſome ſelfe-conceit of their owne way, in others revenge, pettiſhneſſe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.4.</note> froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:45715:107"/> Some encline to the right hand of ſelfe-confidence and content in their owne hopes: others to the left hand of feare and ſlavery. Now the Spirit of Grace,<note place="margin">In ſome ſtronger, in in ſome wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</note> is as fire, devouring that corruption which is next hand, and ſearching out the peculiar diſtemper of the Spirit which beares moſt ſway againſt Grace and Chriſt: It deſcants not about other mens lets and maladies, but lookes at her owne in ſpeciall, ſaying, I doubt not but others finde their owne home and boſome hindrances, let me ſee to mine owne, for other mens ſhall not hurt me. I feele a very ſtout heart loath to take a reproofe, bluſtering at any that ſhould taxe me! what? Do they know what I am, my parts! or thus, I feele a very froward ſpirit, God himſelfe muſt not croſſe and unſettle me, leſt I fly in his face! or thus, I feele a ſtiffe heart of Selfe, loath to doe good, to ſympathize the neceſſities of others, (ſo I may fare well my ſelfe) by viſiting, by adviſing, admoniſhing, inſtructing them. I ſay each one hath his peculiar ayles and humors, which take off the edge of grace in him, and all becauſe there is not that meekeneſſe, tenderneſſe and brokenneſſe of ſpirit, there wants the power of Chriſt to beare downe ſuch diſtempers: But the Spirit of Grace encounters every ſpeciall diſeaſe, diſcovers to every man his owne, abandons that ſpirit which reignes in an hypocrite, who can make a pretty ſhift, till his owne baſeneſſe be found out, but then he buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kells and takes on like a mad man. Not ſo here: For the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus is a Spirit of ſagacity and ſearch, never linning till it can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her ſelfe by the ſent and footings, to her very den, and there ſtrives to drive her out of her hold by violence.</p>
               <p>For why? It preſents to the ſoule the ſafety and happineſſe of ſelfe-diſcovery,<note place="margin">This marke cleared.</note> and the infinite danger of the contrary; cauſeth it to delight in the convincing of her conſcience, and to be loath to foſter in herſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch michiefe, as might deſtroy her own hopes. She ſees how hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites doe exchange Selfe with Selfe, but purge it not out wholly; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to reſigne up her chiefe fort and freehold to the Spirit of Grace without tergiverſation or ſhifting. And ſo, ſhee cries out heartily to the Spirit of Grace, Lord how long ſhall this cloſe enemy of mine main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine her ſelfe againſt thine authority, and trie maſteries with thy Spirit? Haſt thou not yet a further ſtrength to caſt downe this bulwarke? Oh! if thou ſhalt caſt out this defilement to the bottome, ſo, as I may feele a ſweetneſſe in thee to ſupply and equall it, how ſweet a mercy ſhall I count it?</p>
               <p>Beloved, ſearch your ſelves by this. Can you ſay of all theſe dregs of Selfe, Oh, that I might bee rid of them at once! Oh, when ſhall that happy day come! When ſhall I feele the Spirit of Grace thus working to put all out of queſtion! that which is the bane of the falſe heart, is the chiefe joy of a ſound one! when ſhall I feele my ſoule as ſenſibly ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Word, as ever I have beene by Selfe? Oh! if now the houre were come, that all the unclean pleaſures I have taken in my own bottome and ſelfe-ends, were quaſht, how ſhould I rejoyce! And yet I know well what I muſt forgoe, even that which hath been my meat and drinke and paſtime: but I ſpeake adviſedly and in coole bloud, I ſhould be glad of it, and hazard all, and I know they ſhould be as droſſe to me! if thou canſt truly profeſſe this, thine eſtate is comfortable.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:45715:107"/>
               <p>And hereto I may adde this, as a fifth marke, that the Spirit of Grace ſettles and compounds all thoſe objections and cavills whereby Selfe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to rivet her ſelfe in the ſoule; ſhee paſſes ſentence againſt Selfe,<note place="margin">5. Marke. It anſwers all objections of Selfe.</note> and when Selfe hath ſpent her ſelfe in all ſhe can ſay to hold the ſoule in her chaines, yet the Spirit of Grace is ſtronger for Grace, then Selfe for corruption. Notwithſtanding all her eaſe, loathneſſe to part, advantage to the fleſh, difficulty of beleeving, pretences and colours, yet ſo it is, Grace will beare the ſway and perſwades the ſoule to caſt her out. She is as thoſe men of Juda, whoſe words were ſtronger for <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 19 43.</note> then the words of the men of Iſrael. So that let Selfe diſpute what ſhe can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mercy, yet mercy is that which at laſt the poore ſoule muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take her ſelfe to, ſooner or later; and better at firſt, while the heart is tender and willing to take paines, then at laſt, when ſhe is ſapped and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in Selfe. Grace is the thing ſhe aimes at, and although ſhe have had many turnagaines and diſcouragements, yet till ſhe reſts there, and ſets downe her ſtafe upon the promiſe, ſhee ſhall have no reſt or peace in her ſpirit, and therefore, bearing downe all difficulties, cavills and pulbacks, ſhe reſolves upon Grace and the freedome of mercy: This cannot an hypocrite reach unto: for, either he is reſolved to be as he is, or elſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds on in a continuall ſtaggering: If the former, then he is hardened, and will be as he is, if he be in an error, he will live and dye in it, he will not change his eſtate for any mans, hee deſires to be in no better caſe then he is. If the latter, then he is alway deviſing of one ſhift or other to delude his owne conſcience when it checks him for unſoundneſſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it his trade, to daube it with untempered morter. Contrary to both, the Spirit of Grace cauſes the ſoule to bee informed of her owne danger, to be content to heare of the hardeſt, to amend any errors which have miſled her, though with much paine, ſearing or lancing, medicines or plaſters, ſhe is willing to undergoe any hardſhip for a cure, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe nothing, ſo ſhe may be rid of an unſafe condition: and although ſhee knows this divell will not out without foming and raging and much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, yet ſhe doth as the husbandman doth,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11 4.</note> who knowes if hee ſhould obſerve winde and raine, he ſhould neither ſow nor reape: So the Spirit of Grace waites not while the coaſt bee cleare and all objections of Self be anſwered (for ſhe holds her own and will not be anſwered) but breakes through the hoaſt of all cavills, to come to the bare promiſe, and when ſhe cannot untie each knot by picking it, ſhee takes her ſword and cuts them in two at once, that the ſoule may be at liberty.<note place="margin">Zachar. 5.11.</note> And (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeakes of carrying the Ephah into the land of Shinar) ſo doth the Spirit of Grace carry this reſiſtance of Selfe farre away from the ſoule, whence it may never returne any more to peſter her in the maine point of reſolving to caſt her ſelfe nakedly upon Grace and Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Grace oppoſes Selfe, by ſetting Selfe againſt Selfe,<note place="margin">6. Marke.

Hence it comes to paſſe, that when the ſoule hath long traded with her owne affections, devotions and duties, ſatisfying her ſelfe with the warmth of her owne feathers, the Lord ſets another Selfe againſt them, that is, ſuffers ſome morall diſtempers to riſe up in them, as peeviſhneſſe, wandring after fond &amp; frothy vanities, an inconſtancy of ſpirit to unſettle
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:45715:108"/> them, contenting themſelves with the creature, any ſhred of it, eating and drinking, padling in the world or about carnall objects which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they deſpiſed: and why theſe? Surely that they might be gaſtered by the worſe from the better, and being beaten from Self in both kindes, might reſolve to faſten upon that which might bottome them upon Chriſt. I have obſerved it in ſundry, even of tender and good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that through feare and weakneſſe could not bee perſwaded to caſt themſelves upon the onely free and unchangeable truth of the promiſe, there to ſettle and to reſt in Chriſts boſome without ſtrugglings or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of their owne baſe diſtruſt; therefore the Lord hath ſuffered them to be exceedingly diſguiſed and burdenſome to themſelves by the contrary qualities of ſloth, eaſe, weariſomeneſſe, deadneſſe, formality, wrath and other baſer evills. Their former love of the word hath tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to indifferency whether they heare or no; their painfull hearings, meditatings with ſome life and ſavor, praying with devout hearts and fervency, with like care and jealouſie in their other courſe, hath wanzed and waxed weariſome; and thoſe evills which I named, have come in their roome; and when they have felt theſe pricks in their fleſh to buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet them: Oh! how ſad and unſettled have they beene? As a bone out of joint, fit for nothing? Yea, how ſullen with God, quarrelling, as if they never had any good wrought in them, and ſometimes ready to give over all in a tech and mood: Why, (I pray you) doth the Lord leave ſuch painfull ſoules to ſuch diſguiſements? Hath hee delight to croſſe them, to breake the bruſed reed, or to quench the ſmoking flax? No doubtleſſe. Try your ſelves (good brethren) whether or no this hath beene your condition? And if it have, know that the Lord is juſt to deale thus with you (although ye have not perhaps provoked him by an ill conſcience, by running to evill or wilfull rejecting of the meanes) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven becauſe you ſtill reſt upon your owne bottomes, and aſcribe to your duties and affections: he would pull ye off from theſe, and draw you to ſet your ſoules upon better objects.</p>
               <p>I know what objection you will make by and by: That you have alſo (as much as in you hath lyen) ſtrove againſt all reſting in any affections of your owne, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> laboured to deny your ſelves, and to ſettle upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> But I demand why then have you not obtained a bottome to reſt upon? You will ſecretly mutter and ſay, the Lord hath not beene plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to let out any ſaving and effectuall goodneſſe out of his promiſe, to prevent you in your endeavours, and to ſweeten you with the comfort of his Grace, that ſo your labours might not be in vaine? Doth hee not let out ſuch ſweetneſſe as yee would? Where then is the fault? Could you lay the fault upon God? Or thinke you that the error lies within your owne boſome? What way hath God (I pray you) ſave the way of his promiſe, inſeperably attended by his Spirit, to let in and convey himſelfe into the ſoules of his poore ſervants? Surely if you have clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his promiſe for the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, to convey his good things upon your ſoules; then may and ought you to waite his leaſure for the anſwering of your doubtfull hearts; and the Lord will not bee wanting to give you now and then ſuch handſells of mercy, as are meete to ſtay you, and to aſſure you of better meaſures afterward. But ſay the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:45715:108"/> truth: is there not within you a ſecret loathneſſe to give up your owne bottome, hopes and hold, to the meere freedome of eternall mercy? Or have you not kept a falſe meaſure within you, that is, to mixe your ſelves with mercy, being loath to deny your ſelves, your feelings, zeale, labours and devotions? Have you caſt theſe out, and come under the power and authority of the Word? I feare there is ſuch a pad in the ſtraw; If there be not, it is ſome ſin againſt conſcience which hath wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted you, which muſt be abhorred: but if it be as I have ſaid, alas! poor ſoules, then wonder not that God hath croſſed you: for it is for good, even to faſten you to himſelfe, and above all meanes, to acquaint you with his owne power, who in the midſt of theſe diſtempers of yours can forgive you, can imbrace you with mercy, and finde in his heart to love you: (even then when perhaps you could bite your tongues becauſe you are ſo bad:) and this, if you can beleeve it, will carry meate in the mouth, when all your own mixtures muſt vaniſh. Try your ſelves by this marke, whether the Spirit of Grace have ſo wildred you in the beſt and moſt pleaſing waies of your own,<note place="margin">Eſay 26.</note> till he have driven you into your chambers to hide your ſelves there under the ſecret of the Almighty, under that free, infinite, full covert of the promiſe, till the evill be overpaſt. Tell me (bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) when you can feed and revive your ſpirits at this feaſt, and warme your ſelves at this fire, is it not high holy-day with you? Finde you not a difference betweene this and your owne ſparkes? Bee content then, reſigne up your ſoules to this worke, and ſay, the Lord hath done you no wrong to weane you from your owne breaſts, that you might ſuck at his promiſes.</p>
               <p>Seventhly and laſtly, the Spirit of Grace oppoſeth Selfe in all her er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and ſubtilties. For the former, Selfe is a great blinder of the eyes and cauſes the ſoule to ſleep in a whole skin: ſhe doth ſo baffle her ſelfe, with her owne ſhewes and forwardneſſe, that ſhee doubts not, but her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate is good. She ſaith with <hi>Iehu,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Kings 9.</note> Come and ſee the zeale which I have for the Lord of Hoſts. But the Spirit of Grace is a Spirit of diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning between errour and truth, it ſeperates between the pretious and the vile, gives clearneſſe to the eyes of the ſimple,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.</note> cauſing them to judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the grounds of the word, which cannot deceive, &amp; to diſtruſt, her owne conjecturall and ſlight bottomes. Truth is able to approve both her ſelfe and her contrary: whereas error can comprehend neither truth nor her owne vanity. And ſecondly, ſhe diſcovers thoſe ſubtilties of Selfe. It were endleſſe to mention them: by a few judge of the reſt. Sometime ſhe is ſo ſlye, that when her affections and duties forſake her, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſhe can recover her ſelfe by her whinings, complaints and mutterings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her ſelfe; as if ſhe mourned becauſe ſhe attaines no better fruit of her labours. Sometimes ſhe will pretend that ſhe deſires grace really, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and is willing to be ſearched, and that ſhee knowes not that evill which ſhe would not gladly be rid of, that ſhe might attaine it. But yet ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives herſelfe with dead wiſhes, and will not enſue thoſe meanes cloſely which tend thereto, nor profit by the experience of her owne baſeneſſe; but her experience leaves her dead in the neſt, as it found her, and ſhe will not endure the triall, nor ſet one foot forward to remove the ſtumbling-blocke of her iniquity from before her,<note place="margin">Ezek. 14.</note> and her Idols from between her
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:45715:109"/> breſt: Therein ſhe is as ſhe was. Againe a third ſubtilty is, that ſhe will ſpare her owne lazy skin, and cut her ſelfe off from thoſe more convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ordinances and more pertinent and ſeaſonable meanes for her owne good, by putting herſelfe upon ſuch as are lawfull and good in their kinde; as to avoid cloſe attendance to reading of the word, by ſinging of a Pſalme; alſo prayer by reading a Chapter; inſtead of ſecret and private prayer, ſhe will chuſe to pray with others, or in family, or upon a booke; inſtead of extraordinary duties, ſhee will content herſelfe with her ordinary houres; and all to ſhew, that ſhee is glad to put off the Lord and ſave herſelfe harmeleſſe with as ſmall a pittance and as poore meaſures of ſpirit and courage as may be. And commonly when Selfe pitches upon her courſe, this is her property, ſhe is looſe with God in the beſt meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Againe, ſhe will ſo contrive her matters, that for the ſhifting of ſome cloſe duty of worſhip, as meditation, ſearching her corruptions, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after falls, or renewing covenant: ſhe will alway finde ſome occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or other, duty of calling, converſing with others needleſly, or by ſome worke of mercy and duty of the ſecond Table, or any other fained pretence, to rid herſelfe of that which would ſtick to her ſpirit, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> her looſe grounds. Sometime (which I would have marked) when ſhe is ſo hunted, that ſhe cannot ſhelter herſelfe, and is preſſed to leave all for a promiſe; ſhe will turne preſumptuous, and profeſſe that ſhe hath caſt herſelfe upon that alſo, and thereby hath put an end to all her former diſtempers, purpoſing to caſt about and fling out no more, but ſettle herſelfe upon the truth of God: But alas! this her fained clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the word, is nothing elſe, ſave a dead relyance; perhaps ſhee quaſhes her former feares and doubts: But how? Surely by a lazy and ſlothfull pretence of beleeving, that ſhe might be free from any callings upon, reproofes or paines taking, and delude her ſelfe with eaſe: for why? Come to the triall of her confidence, alas! it is without ſavor, peace, contentation or joy of heart, ſapleſſe, barren and ventrous: diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a ſelfe-deniall and calmneſſe of heart, but indeed a lethargy of the ſpirit willing to deceive herſelfe. No true deſire to honour God in the fruit of a ſound courſe, or to purge out old diſtempers can appeare. I ſay, all the ſubtill and ſly tricks of ſelfe-deluſion the Spirit of Grace pierceth into and purgeth the ſoule of: for, looke what I have ſaid of a few, might be ſaid of all the reſt: Although I deny not, but many a poor ſoule hath ſome ſecret ſhreds of Selfe lying hid and unknowne; yet I ſay the nature of the Spirit is to diſcover them, if the ſoule be not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereto. And this be ſaid touching the former generall head of the Spirits oppoſing Selfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Second gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. How the Spirit of grace that it ſerves wholly for Grace. In three things. 1. In diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of it.</note>Now for the ſecond generall; a ſecond marke of the Spirit of Grace is, That it ſerves wholly for Grace: And that both in the diſcovery of Grace, in the effects of that diſcovery, and the end of it. For the firſt of theſe. The Spirit of Grace is all for Grace, in the diſcovery of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of it, the ampleneſſe, largeneſſe, height, depth and length of it to the poore ſoule, that it may appeare in all the excellency and fulneſſe, freedome, bounty, unchangeableneſſe and wel be teamingneſſe thereof; that no corner of it may lie hidden from the heart of a ſinner, ſo farre as
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:45715:109"/> may further him in the bottoming of the ſoule in mercy. This is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and peculiar act of the Spirit, tending to this end, that the ſoule may not ſtagger about the ſufficiency of Grace which God offers unto her; but may behold the power of the Prieſthood of Chriſt, once offering up himſelfe as a compleat and ſpotleſſe ſacrifice and ſatisfaction for the ſins of the elect, needing no more to be offered; able to procure from the Father endleſſe wel pleaſedneſſe and acceptance, alſo a free offer of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and to create in the ſoule alone and of it ſelfe, (without any antecedent free will, liking and cooperating of Selfe) a moſt ſufficient clearing of conſcience from guilt and feare, yeſterday,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.3. Heb. 13.8.</note> to day and for ever. This cannot ſinke into the heart of an hypocrite; he cannot bee perſwaded that there is enough in the Lord Jeſus alone, to diſcharge him in the Court of heaven; the offer and promiſe are empty noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with him, to ſway all his ſtrength upon; neither dare hee reſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon with peace without a further addition of his owne feelings. But the Spirit of Grace grounds the poore ſoule in this, as the maine worke of all, that ſo all the building may ſubſiſt thereon; and makes ſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat and refuge for her in the midſt of her diſtreſſe, that her foundation may not be ſhaken. I wiſh that the method of that Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, eſpecially in the 7.8.9.10. Chap. might well be obſerved to the underſtanding of this act of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Spirit of Grace doth not onely offer ſuch a light to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſoule, but lets it in by her owne working into her, ſetting the ſoule on worke, to concurre with his revealing light, and ſhewing it both that the Lord will conferre no leſſe then all this Sufficiency upon a needing ſoule, and therefore ſhee may (without preſumption) take and partake them from his hand: It ſheweth her that it is the endleſſe &amp; matchleſſe Grace of God, that he can find in his heart to pardon her, yea to caſt love upon her, not only when ſhe ſeems zealous and affectionate (for Self can make her beleeve that) but even when ſhe is baſeſt in her owne eies, and under the conſcience of her guilt; when ſhe is in her bloud, when her originall loathſomeneſſe &amp; her actuall wickednes of thoughts, of words, of wrath, hypocriſie and the like, doe lye as a burthen upon her, yet then, even then (marke what I ſay) he hath love in a corner of his heart, for ſuch an one; (ſuch as he will have herſelfe confeſſe to be) cauſleſſe on her part, yea ſuch, as (if he had no more aime at being knowne to be loving, then to love for any amiable thing in the object) he would never ſhew to any. Nay more, leſt the Spirit of Grace ſhould leave any thing behinde him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> he doth offer to create the gift of faith in the ſoule,<note place="margin">Eſay 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.19.</note> to claſpe upon this gift of mercy; and includes this gift in the offer, as knowing that it were in vaine to offer the one, without working the other. And hereby he cauſeth the ſoule to lay hold upon his ſtrength and ablity to ſave, (as having received a ranſome ſufficient:) which is no other, ſaving the writing of his covenant in the fleſhy tables of her heart,<note place="margin">Eſay 27 4.5.</note> prepared by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for the nonce.</p>
               <p>And moreover, that all this hee hath done of his owne free will and motion, without any former principle acting him to intend it, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with him to create it: I ſay, he hath done it of himſelfe, as judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it meet for himſelfe to doe (whatſoever we bee) and for the glory of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:45715:110"/> his Name: No entreaty of men or Angels, no difficult tearmes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion cauſed it: but it flowed naturally from him, as moſt honourable to his Majeſtie to doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, the Spirit of Grace ſtayes not here, but proceedes to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the ſoule to embrace this power of God: for to what end ſhould the Lord be willing to do it in her &amp; for her, except ſhe alſo felt ſutable inclinations wrought in her ſoul towards it: And therefore he moves her, ſadly to digeſt this grace offered, to count it no light nor ſtrange thing; no nor yet beyond the ſoules apprehenſion; but as on the one ſide hee cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it to be moſt weighty, pretious, and to be highly valued: ſo, on the other ſide he makes it familiar, ſweet, clear and evident: not a thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the clouds, nor under the earth, farre fetcht, but neere the ſoule, put into her boſome,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> belonging to her, not to bee rejected, or thruſt away from her, except ſhe will periſh. Theſe, together with the infinite bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of receiving it, and the endleſſe loſſe in forgoing it (as being the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedy) doe marvellouſly ſtabliſh the thoughts upon it, and raviſh the affections with it, ſo that layes a moſt ſad charge upon the poore ſoule (upon paine of forfeiting her peace for ever) not to paſſe it by ſlightly, deadly, and formally; but to view and meditate of it ſavourly, deep y, unw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ariedly, with admiration, till by this mirrour of beholding the Lord with open face, ſhe be transformed to the gloriouſnes of this grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and carried,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. end.</note> yea left in the ſtreame thereof by the Spirit of the Lord. This for the firſt of the three particulars.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, is the effect of this preſenting worke of the Spirit. And that is union:<note place="margin">The ſecond worke the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hereof, viz. Union.</note> Whereby the Spirit of Grace ſhewes the ſoule into what a condition ſhe is tranſlated by faith in the promiſe. That is, ſhe is made one with the Lord Jeſus thereby, and really partaker of all his good things, true peace, contentment in bleſſings, croſſes, all conditions, freedome from all former garboiles, feares, enemies, joy in God and his ſalvation, never to be divorced from him any more. This cauſes the ſoule to ſhake off that weariſomeneſſe of Selfe, never ſettled; that bottomeleſſeneſſe, never grounded; that inconſtancy and vanity, never at reſt: and why? Becauſe it had no reall good to faſten upon, and to determine thoſe reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe deſires of hearts: But now, the Lord Jeſus himſelfe both in his preſent grace and hope of glory to come, runues in her ſtreame, or rather turnes hers into his: ſo that looke what Selfe was to her before, emptily and barrenly: now Chriſt is in her ſtead. Chriſt is the Selfe of the ſoule; he is all in all to her, acts her, comforts her, ſtaies her, quickens her, guides, upholds her in all ſtraits and troubles. As Selfe was a body of death in her before, eaſily beſetting her; ſo is Chriſt now a very reall being of Truth and Grace, a very life of being and welfare unto her. Now the ſoule is willing to ſhake off Selfe, becauſe ſhe hath a better thing in poſſeſſion; which frees her from the old yrkeſomeneſſe, vanity, bondage and unſubſiſtence, which before ſhe was diſquieted with. Oh! it is a wonderfull priviledge to a poore ſoule, that whereas before it was tedious to her to muſe of the promiſe, to deny her owne hopes, flaſhes and pangs, to cleave to the bottome of another out of herſelfe: now all theſe are become ſweet unto her, becauſe Chriſt is now inſtead of Selfe unto her, even all in all. Before it was a violent worke to apply
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:45715:110"/> the ſoule to meditation; for ſhe was out of the element of Grace; but now ſhe counts it familiar worke, becauſe the preſence of Chriſt hath made it ſo: a mercy more worth, then all the world beſide, when ſhee conſiders duly of it. Before ſhee was haled as a Beare to the ſtake, to the word, to the ſacraments, to other ordinances, duties: now ſhe hath fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with them as her owne, even as ſhe is Chriſts: before ſhe knew not what to make of herſelfe, her affections, her deſires; but now ſhee is able to diſcerne what God hath done for her and her affections, mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and duties, ſtand not up in the roome of Chriſt, but flow from him ſafely, and returne to him, as the waters to the ſea, whence they came. Oh! what oddes is there betweene the dead life of Selfe, moving the ſoule heavily, as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> charet wanting their wheeles; and the living life of Chriſt, alway affording ſome warmth, vigor, breath and motion to the ſoule, and aſſuring her that is not from herſelfe, but from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple without, which will not faile her: Oh! this ſecond <hi>Adams</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſpirit, is as far above that dead principle of Selfe, as a living creature is above an Image.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Spirit of Grace drawes the ſoule to the end of Grace!<note place="margin">The third is the end.</note> to behold the purpoſe of God in declaring the riches of that mercy, by which he ſaved a ſinner: that he might purchaſe more glory to himſelfe, then good to the ſoule. Of this I ſpake before by another occaſion: only note this, that the Spirit carries Selfe out of the ſoule hereby. For when the ſoule is raviſhed with the view of thoſe excellencies of God manifeſted by redemption, ſhe loſeth herſelfe as in a ſtreame, as being aſhamed to thinke that ſhe ſhould ſo baſely ſtruggle for that, by her own ſtrength, which onely the Spirit of the promiſe can conduct her unto, for the ends of the promiſe, ſerving to make the Lord admirable in his Saints: Oh! how is the ſoul aſhamed, yea confounded for her own folly, that ſhe ſhould goe about the fadoming of ſo bottomeleſſe depth, with her owne bucket! I conclude theſe three branches with renewing my exhortation: Try your ſelves by theſe, whether the Spirit of Grace bee in you or no; for if it be, it hath the promiſe of a full bottome to ſtabliſh the ſoule upon, it hath brought realneſſe of comfort and peace into it, and it hath carried it into the ſea of the riches of grace, ſo that it can make ſongs of the Lords deliverance, with more admiration, then if the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of a Prince had befalne it. I cannot inſiſt now any longer. So much for the ſecond marke, that the Spirit of Grace is for Grace.</p>
               <p>To make an end, a third and laſt marke of the Spirit of Grace is,<note place="margin">The third marke is, The calme proceeding of this Spirit of Grace.</note> that it goeth forward calmely and ſoftly in her purſuit of the promiſe, without any carnall ſtriving and violence of Selfe, much leſſe fretting and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of ſpirit upon Gods delaies. She teaches the ſoule to waite upon the Lord and harken what he would ſay to his Saints, for he will ſpeake peace to them, that they may not returne to folly, their old ſelfe-ſtagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, unſettledneſſe or bondage: The Spirit of Grace is much like the Temple of <hi>Salomon;</hi> it loves not to hear the din of Selfe to diſquiet it,<note place="margin">Pſal. 85.8.</note> as hammers and tooles might not bee uſed in the building of the other.<note place="margin">1 King. 6.7.</note> While he is at worke, he cannot endure Selfe to diſturbe him: he will raiſe up the frame himſelfe, we muſt onely ſay, Grace, grace unto it, but he will both lay the foundation and corner ſtone,<note place="margin">Zach. 4.7.</note> and ſet the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

For why?<note place="margin">Why moſt men ſo little deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for Chriſt?</note> To deny a mans ſelfe for Chriſt, requires a better bottome then they have any: The Lord Jeſus never denyed himſelfe to the death for the redemption of their ſoules, never gave himſelfe as a price to wrath for their pardon and peace: The Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> tells us, Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe for a good man one would be content to dye: Chriſt hath not been a good Chriſt to them, for if he had, they would deny themſelves to the death for him.

               <p>Beſides, they know not what ſpirit they are of; while peace laſteth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and the Goſpel runnes in the ſtreame of their liberties, gifts, ſervices, commodities, and advantages, who but they?

Now their great declaiming againſt the ſinnes of timeſervers, and ſelfe-loving hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, is turned to apologize for their inconſtancy, ſelfe-love and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ends of their owne: Moreover, another cauſe is, they ſought not Chriſt ſimply and honeſtly for himſelfe, but for ſomewhat which might bee gotten from him, to ſerve their owne turne by his meanes: They know not how to licke themſelves whole upon the Lord Jeſus for any thing they loſe for him; and therefore they are loath to venture any more,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:45715:112"/> then they muſt quite make forfeit of. If they knew whom to truſt for amends, or could beleeve that hundred fold requitall for God and his Goſpel, which is promiſed to all that loſe any thing for him; Oh! it would lithe their hearts exceedingly to ſuffer any thing for him! To <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> conclude, they conſider not what a poore bargaine they make of it, when they ſell the honour and glory of the Lord Jeſus, for the redeeming of a poore tranſitory content here below: they conſider not that they fiſh with a golden hooke for minums; if they loſe their hooke upon a ſhrag of triall and temptation, they can never make amends againe for it, by all they catch, though the fiſh were fairer. Conſcience is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity to weigh in the balance againſt eaſe, and carnall profits and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: as <hi>Eliſha</hi> asked <hi>Gehazi,</hi> Is this a ſeaſon to purchaſe olives and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and menſervants or maidſervants? They conſider not what poor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and ſilly figleaves they ſow together to cover their nakedneſſe, when they pretend a neceſſity of ſerving God their owne way, (that way which will hold beſt agreement with their own ends) to ſhun ſerving him his way of ſuffering, which contradicts their ſelf-love. In all theſe reſpects and in many more, let us not wonder at the wofull declenſion of theſe revolting times, which leave the Lord Jeſus himſelfe to ſinke or ſwim. Nay further, let us not be offended overmuch at ſuch as at their firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and onſet upon Religion, ſeemed ſo zealous as to chalenge all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt, and began to ſuffer for him: But having born the brunt a while, and felt the triall too hot and too heavy for them, have with more ſhame and reproach revolted from him, then ever they began to ſuffer with honour and commendation.</p>
               <p>And ſithence it fareth thus, let all whom it concerneth,<note place="margin">Counſells to helpe this.

Conſider (poore ſoule) by whoſe ſtrength thou ſtandeſt: do not look too wiſely upon next hand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ſtaggerers and timeſervers, though perhaps thou haſt admired them for their zeale and gifts: know them by their fruits; ſtagger not at their revolts: But looke to Jeſus the author and finiſher of thy faith,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> who for the hope ſet before him, and the love to thy ſoule and ſalvation, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed the ſhame, and endured the croſſe: Behold (if examples do ſo much affect thee) the patternes of thoſe faithfull ones, who in all ages have borne witneſſe to Jeſus, and not eſteemed their credits, or goods, or lives, ſo that they might vindicate the glory of Chriſt, and diſcharge the truſt which in baptiſme, and much more in their converſion to God was committed to them; to be faithfull ſouldiers, and to contend for the truth, againſt Divell and his inſtruments, the world and their own fleſhly ſelfe-love: The Lord hath had in all ages ſome who have though it a buſineſſe of importance to ſticke to Chriſt and his honour, whatſoever it coſt them; although thy ſtrength be ſmall, the trialls of the malicious ſharpe and fiery as darts; yet if thou canſt deny thine owne ſelfe, humble thy ſoule, be little in thine owne eies, be above thine owne ends and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality: Then that God who hath ſuffered thouſands of ſubtill ſelfe-loving
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:45715:113"/> hypocrites to fall on thy right hand, and thy left, ſhall keepe thee ſafe in the midſt under the covert of the wings, and ſhadow of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power.<note place="margin">Pſal. 92.7.

Beleeve that hee who nayled all enmity of Satan and the gates of hell, to his croſſe, hath riſen by the might of his Godhead, and is at his right hand; will ſo provide, that the remnant of their conquered and captivated malignity and malice, ſhall never prevaile againſt thee. If ever thou tookeſt hold of his ſtrength to ſave thee from hell and from periſhing, truſt him for ſtrength to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all earthly enemies; he can and will ſubdue them unto thee, divert them, diſarme them, diſable them, and give thee full redemption from them. If ever hee built thee ſoundly upon his rocke, feare not, neither ſtormes, nor ſands, nor tempeſts, nor any aſſaults ſhall ever cauſe thy building to ruinate: but thou ſhalt ſtand, becauſe built upon a rock.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, be not heedleſſe and careleſſe of trouble, but be well ſettled and informed in thy judgement, concerning the weight and the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the truth of God. Let not trouble for the cauſe of Chriſt, finde thee ſo buſied about doing for him, that thou ſhouldeſt neglect the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thoſe weighty reſpects, for which he calls thee to ſuffer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Many irreſolute and ſtaggering ones have done Chriſt as much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, as ſome libertines and timeſervers: Selfe-love and eaſe hath ſo blinded them on the one ſide, that they can looke but one way: As thou canſt not deny but truth is pretious, powerfull, and prevailing: So adde this thereto, aske what is truth, ſtudy it, inquire into it, &amp; the conſequences which attend upon, both the faithfull ſticking to it, againſt all enemies, and the treacherous traducing it, for fear, or flattery, or any ſiniſter ends. Remember that of <hi>Davids</hi> ſervants, and apply it to truth, thou art worth tenne thouſand of us, if we fall, there be others to raiſe up in our ſtead; but if thou fall, how irrecoverable is thy loſſe? And ſay not, this truth or that, I could ſuffer for, but ſuch and ſuch I dare not; for if thou honor not God in denying thy owne cavils, and ſuffering for any truth, perhaps thou ſhalt be ſo left to thy ſelfe-ſhifts, and ſnared by thine owne treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that either God will deny thee an heart, or the honour to ſuffer in greater truths, if occaſion ſerve.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, know for certaine, God will have a day to trie thee, what coſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> thou wilt be at for him. If he have brought thee through the pikes of the enemies of thy converſion; truſt to it, he will have ſome triall or other, to know all that is in thine heart. God beſtowes no great favours (eſpecially Chriſt himſelfe) but he will be ſure to try thee throughly of what mettall thou art made, and whether the experience of his firſt and greateſt love have deſerved at thine hands the fruit of thy faith, to cling to him, and be of more worth, then thine owne ends and contents: He rejoyceth to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:45715:113"/> thoſe who are firme to him, and beare him hearty loyall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, from the hollow and falſe. If <hi>Abraham, Hezechia, Ionah, Peter,</hi> wanted not their trialls, (of whom ſome ſtuck to God, others warped) ſhalt thou eſcape? Nay if God would try <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and <hi>Iehu,</hi> ſo deepely, will he paſſe thee over? No bee not ſuch a foole as to thinke that thou ſhalt ſcape in a miſt; ſwimme alway in a calme ſea, and runne a ſmooth courſe; for as verily as God is true, thou ſhalt be tried, yea perhaps many wayes, one after another. Reſolve thy ſelfe, it is no ſlight thing in Gods eſteeme to try his: if he ſhould leave them without trialls, (whereof all ſonnes are partakers) they were baſtards:<note place="margin">Heb. 12.8.</note> it is droſſe and no oare which is not worth the trying: eaſie duties of praying, hearing and worſhip are no trialls for Gods cloſe people in theſe dayes, he will have other trialls for them; and although perhaps thou hadſt ſcaped many windes and blaſts, yet he will have ſome direct and oppoſite winde to try thee to the quicke, ere the Lord have done with thee. Selfe had need have trialls as <hi>Gideons</hi> ſouldiers.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe conſiderations, apply this exhortation briefly to thy ſelfe.<note place="margin">Application of all in two du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> Be for him that hath beene for thee even the Lord Jeſus, be for his glory and honour to thy uttermoſt. I will commend but two paſſages to thee. Firſt in the feare of God (my beloved) be ſure that you deny your ſelves for God in the point of doing for him. Secondly,<note place="margin">1.

I urge no exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe but ſuch as the Goſpel both promiſes and affords to a beleeving ſoule; onely I exclude treachery and falſhood. For the former, aime at God, and deny thy ſelfe in thy doings and duties, in thy worſhip and uſe of meanes, in thy ſpeciall calling and condition of life. This will inure thee to the latter ſelfe-deniall in ſuffering: Throughout thy whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of life towards God and man, thou ſhalt finde, that (from the center of ſelfe-love) the Divell will teach thee to draw lines of crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and obliquity, warping from God, and tending to it ſelfe. The ſoule cannot endure to be under the authority of God, either comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, promiſing, or threatning; it hath a bredth of her owne, in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of God,<note place="margin">See Hoſ. 10.1.</note> and where ſhee can fleece away ought from him and his ends to herſelfe ſhe is ſafe; yea where the duties are ſtricteſt, ſhee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraies moſt a falſe heart, which being pincht in the point of her owne ends, is ready to caſt all in the dirt.

In preaching the ſolemne truthes of God, what a deale of ſelfe-honour and men-pleaſing creeps into the duty? What duties, meanes or graces are there, which are void of this dead fly? Witneſſe the innumerable diſpenſations which this libertine age ſeekes to herſelfe in all her wayes; in faſhions, attires, recreations, worldly dealings, lending, letting, hyring and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing: In the duty of prayer how ſcanty, ſeldome, carnall, are wee? Looking ſometime more at them that heare us, or at the ſetneſſe of our ſentences, edge of our owne affections, then at Gods awfull preſence, our owne abaſement, or the ſpeciall ends that concerne us? What cauſes ſo

Selfe-love; every man lookes to his owne matters, his owne griefes, loſſes take up all his teares and deſires? What cauſes Magiſtrates to be ſo partiall and connivent at offenders, at drunkards, breakers of the Sabbath? Selfe-love, they are affraid to be noted to bee precizer then needs, they ſeeke their owne bribes or eaſe; men are loath to diſquiet themſelves for God or conſcience: Whence comes our murmuring under our croſſes, or our ſottiſhneſſe and inſenſibleneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them?

True it is, to ſhunne God, and ſeeke our ſelves, our owne eaſe and welfare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying our conſcience, is a fearefull treachery; but yet, there is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſchiefe then this to be ſhunned; and that is, be we ſure that wee ſuffer for God, and have him that knowes our hearts to beare us witneſſe, that (ſetting aſide humane frailty) the ſincere aime of our hearts in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, is, the promoting of the glory of God, and the entire and tender reſpect we have to preſerve his truth inviolable: There is a white divell corrupting us in the bent and aime of our ſufferings, as well as a blacke, to diſſwade us from ſuffering at all: one Divell (under two colours) aimes at this, either at the loſſe of our ſoules, when we wickedly ſeeke to ſave our ſelves from ſuffering, or the loſſe of the honour of our ſufferings, when we loſe our reward, through our baſe and hollow ſeeking our own ſelves. Such as ſuffer in theſe dayes for Chriſt, had need be well botto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and carried upon ſuch grounds as will beare us out and ſave our ſtake. For, ſuch as ſuffer out of a proud, preſumptuous ſingularity of their own, to be thought ſome body, hoping they ſhall be able to licke themſelves whole by ſome outward encouragements, or otherwiſe ruſh upon croſſes in their heate and raſhneſſe; are like (in ſuch a world as this) to meet with a wrong match of it. And we have ſeene ſome examples before our eies to verifie this by wofull experience,<note place="margin">Note this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</note> that others may learne by their ſhame and harmes, to beware of their ſelfe-heate and raſhneſſe. The Divell getting ground, and the cauſe of God loſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly by ſuch Merchant venturers, not to ſpeake of the ſhipwracke that ſuch make of their owne peace. Suffer therefore for Chriſt; and ſuffer ſo for him, that thy conſcience may ſtand by thee for the ſincerity
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:45715:114"/> of thine intentions; and the Spirit of glory ſhall reſt upon thee, and with <hi>Stephen,</hi> he (whoſe cauſe thou ſuffereſt for) ſhall diſcover himſelfe unto thee, not onely in his allowing of thee,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.14. Acts 7.55.</note> but his crowning of thee both here with the honour of ſuffering, and hereafter with glory for ſuffering, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. end, and in neither reſpect will he ſuffer thee to repent or bee aſhamed. But I muſt not here (in this uſe of addition and by conſequent) runne out into a common place; ſome other fitter occaſion will offer it ſelfe for this purpoſe. Thus much ſhall ſerve for the whole exhortation; and ſo for the whole doctrine of Selfe, ſo farre as the Lord hath given grace. Now what ſhall I ſay, (brethren) for concluſion, but preſſe us all to ſeeke God, who ſuffers not his raines and dew to returne in vain,<note place="margin">Eſay 55.9.</note> but to fructifie his truth in the hearts of his owne people, that he would not withdraw his bleſſing from this doctrine, which wee have at large inſiſted on in this and the former Sermon?

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former verſe (beloved in the Lord) wee have examined the ground of <hi>Naamans</hi> diſtaſte of the Prophets meſſage: and that was (as wee have ſhewed) a prejudice or pre-conceit of a way of his owne deviſing,<note place="margin">The clear ng of the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, &amp; ſenſe of this verſe.</note> without bottome or ground of truth. Touching the which, as we noted whence it came, even from the root of Selfe, ſo we raiſed a generall ground of doctrine from it; and have ſaid what God hath ſuggeſted unto our thoughts, concerning the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, openings, and ſeverall uſes of it, repeating nothing thereof: let us come forward to this twelfth verſe. For although the holy Ghoſt doth omit ſundry paſſages of this ſtory (as the thing was carried) yet hee will not have us ignorant of any materiall thing, which might profit us: And therefore here he relates the amplification of <hi>Naamans</hi> diſtaſte, from a ſecond allegation of his; and that is, from a ſupply of Selfe, by carnall reaſon. No two friends in the world are ſo ready to ſuccour each other at a pinch, as carnall reaſon is at hand to ſuccour Self. The more is ſaid, the worſe the diſeaſe rankles; but yet that which ſound reaſon cannot make good, lo, carnall reaſon muſt be faine to ſupply. A poore help (I grant) but a poore one is better then none with a corrupt heart. If the former anſwer and bottome of his diſtaſte had been as good as it was large, he had not now needed to have multiplied ſo many words as he doth: but being crazie in them, hee muſt make that good with words which wants ſubſtance: and therefore hee now comes in with an argument of another kinde to ſtiffen himſelfe in his former conceit, drawne from the nature of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:45715:115"/> the meſſage it ſelfe; to wit, that it was unlikely, ridiculous, and in truth (upon point) impoſſible: And therefore he did well to turne away and be angry, as he was.</p>
               <p>The words come to thus much, as if he had ſaid:<note place="margin">How he ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>k<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth one evill with another.</note> There was cauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to reject the Prophets anſwer, becauſe it croſſeth mine expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; my thoughts were farre otherwiſe then his meſſage, I looked hee would have come himſelfe and diſpatcht it; therefore I had reaſon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough before to recoile from his anſwer: But now, put caſe my conceit be ungrounded, and I my ſelfe faulty therefore; yet, let me but examine the meſſage it ſelfe, as it lies, and there is great cauſe to diſtaſte it, in that regard alſo. For why? What ſenſe or reaſon is there in it? Forſooth he bids me goe waſh in Jordan? And what likelihood is there that Jordan ſhould heale leproſie? When was it ever heard of till now? What need Iſrael have one Leper in it, if Jordan will heale him? And, ſure I am, if waters were able to doe it, then much more would better waters doe it. Wee have two famous rivers in Damaſcus, Abana and Pharfar by name, farre purer ſtreames, and (in repute) better waters, then either Jordan, or any other waters of Iſrael whatſoever: And, if they never healed a Leper, much leſſe (I trow) can Jordan. This being thus, who ſhould blame me for rejecting this meſſage? Yea, for diſtemper and anger? Can fleſh and bloud endure to be ſent for to a Prophet, and to be thus mocked? I conclude therefore, his meaning is nothing leſſe, then to cure my diſeaſe: he doth but try my patience, and put a trick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and ſo my labour is loſt. This is the view of this verſe. Now, what doth all this amount unto? Surely (in a word) to confute and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavill the meſſage, by carnall reaſon, and ſuch abſurdities as might grow thence. For why? Hee diſputes thus; This meſſage is againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, unlikely, yea impoſſible to reaſon, therefore ridiculous and falſe; the conſequence of it makes it abſurd: for (I ſay againe) if waters would heale, what need any to bee Lepers in Iſrael? And why may not better waters much better doe it? Therefore, away, talke no further to me of it, leave me to my ſelf, no man ſhall beat out my brains, or ever perſwade me to that which common ſenſe doth ſo notoriouſly contradict.</p>
               <p>But, O <hi>Naaman!</hi> whither wilt thou?<note place="margin">The abſurdity of his reaſon.</note> Is it not too much for thee to be mad with Selfe, but thou wilt alſo be mad with reaſon? In thy former anſwer thou playedſt but the foole: for what although thou thoughtſt ſo and ſo? Was the Prophet tied to thy thoughts? Or could the Prophet doe more or leſſe without warrant from God? Cameſt thou to a Phyſitian with a fee, or to God for a miracle? If to God, why ſuffereſt thou not him to caſt the skole, and to worke his owne way, and to confute thine? And now in this latter anſwer, thou wilt be mad with reaſon. For why? Put caſe the way of waſhing in Jordan bee irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and non-ſenſe to thy wit and reaſon; and what though there bee ſtill ſo many in Iſrael unhealed? And what if Abana bee a purer ſtreame? Doſt thou come to the Prophet to be cured by plaiſters, and by skill of a man, or by the power of God? If this latter, why art thou ſo mad as to tye a ſuperiour cauſe to the inferiour? Or to judge that to bee the health of thy diſeaſe, which is but a ſigne? Or to run to the creature
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:45715:116"/> from the Divinity and Omnipotencie of a Creator? Or, what haſt thou to doe to run to other Lepers? Or to compare Jordan with other waters? Look thou up to God, whoſe power exceeds all thy ſenſe, who ſeeks the honour of his owne worke, not of a creature, and be content to be cured againſt and above all reaſon and ſenſe, ſo thou mayſt bee really cured: It is thy priviledge above all other Lepers in Iſrael, to bee thus cured by <hi>Eliſha.</hi> Cavill not therefore againſt thy priviledge: it is not Jordans water more then any other (by any vertue of it) which muſt heale thee (for then indeed Abana might doe it as well or better) but the God and ruler of Jordan and all creatures to ſerve h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Two things then we ſee in this verſe: Firſt, the carnall exception here taken by <hi>Naaman</hi> againſt the meſſage, which ſet him further off the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and wronged him more and more of his owne hope. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the iſſue and effect of both the former anſwer, and this cavill: hee concludeth that the Prophet mocks him, and therefore in ſtead of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the former reverend eſteeme of his perſon, now hee falles downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to rage and raile upon him, to fret and fume at his defeat, and to turne his back homeward; rather then he will give up his two weapons, he will needs depart and goe home, a moſt naſty Leper as he came.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                  </label> From the former of theſe two, viz. <hi>Naamans</hi> exception, and the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volouſneſſe of it, I might ſtay the Reader upon this meditation; How full and fertile a baſe heart of corruption and unbeliefe is of ſtoppes and barres to deprive it ſelfe of welfare and happineſſe; yea, as one wave fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth another,<note place="margin">Corruption is full of trickes and devices to hurt it ſelfe.</note> ſo doth one cavill back another, and all to deprive it ſelfe of any bleſſing which is fairly toward it. And how manifold argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments one upon the neck of another, it can invent and deviſe of all ſorts, to ſtrengthen it ſelfe in her owne once conceited error? Rather then <hi>Naaman</hi> here will ſeeme to ſhrinke one jot from his former hold, marke what cavils he deviſes againſt the way of God, and his owne welfare: ſo peremptory, ſo reſolute, ſo witty and wiſe hee is to doe himſelfe hurt! but as for doing himſelfe any good, to gueſſe at any intention of God, or the Prophet in this thing, or to call himſelfe off from his humour, to more adviſed thoughts, we ſee it is farre from him. So true it is (not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Heathens) My people are wiſe for evill,<note place="margin">See Jer. 4.22. Reaſon of it.</note> both to doe and to defend it; but for good, exceeding ſilly and ſorry. For why? Not onely it is our lot to be deprived of God, and all his goodneſſe, but alſo wee are depraved in all our abilities and powers of ſoule and body, from coveting any recovery of it; yea more, wee bend all the force of our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, judgements, memories, wills and affections, to the riveting and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing of our ſpirits in that dangerous eſtate in which we are: There is not a drop or dram of any propenſity in us, to uſe any faculty of reaſon in us, to any other end or purpoſe, ſave to overthrow our ſelves, and to implunge our ſelves more deeply in our owne evill: But to dreame of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny out-gate of miſery, or to harpe upon any ſtring of invention, art or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice how to breake the ſnare and get out, it is a gift which is denied us, ſo farre as unregenerate. A ſigne moſt evident, in how well pleaſing a frame and ſtreame wee conceive our ſelves to bee, when as all our wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:45715:116"/> ſerves for nothing elſe, ſave to deviſe reaſons to hold us; yea, wedge us ſtill more deſperately in our unhappy condition: and to wrangle againſt whatſoever might whiſper or ſound toward the fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us out of that thraldome. Aske but a man whom God hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poized and perſwaded by the Spirit of grace, and he will tell you, through how infinite many cavils, objections and diſſwaſives of fleſh, the Lord hath brought him to the condition wherein he now ſtands: and, ere hee could ever feele the ſtreame of his ſpirit framed for God, and the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of the meſſage of ſalvation.</p>

So doth the Lord bring his through manifold ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, objections, temptations, and the whole Army of corrupt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which both within and without beſet the ſoule againſt the naked truth of the promiſe, before ever he ſet them at liberty.</p>
               <p>And the truth is, onely the worke of regeneration is able, both to drein away this ſpring and floud of contradiction, and to dry up her ſtreames, that they may not ſo abundantly flow out to beare downe all the force of truth in us, or perſwade us to converſion.

Others ſay, If yee heare the Preacher, yee will loſe your wits, and drowne or fore-doe your ſelves. Others yet come cloſer, and cavill thus, Wee ſee the more we are terrified for ſinne, the further we are from God. God hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed all to bee ſaved: all cannot mourne or beleeve, it is the gift of few, we know not whom God hath choſen: men may fall away after they have beleeved; and (if ſome ſay true) the juſtified may revolt and be damned; and they can be no worſe, though they never begin: Many goe ſo farre as few can match them, and yet for one cauſe or other, they muſt prove hypocrites and loſe their labour; therefore they will ſave theirs altogether: they had as good ſit for nought as toyle for nought. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Others ſay, their corruptions doe ſo weary them, that they ſhall never get through them: and others are afraid that they ſhall never perſevere, but (at one time or other) fall foully, and diſhonour their Religion: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> therefore dare not give the on-ſet.

To ſay with that rare patterne, yet Lord the dogges may eate crummes &amp;c. ſo anſwering the objections of her Saviour againſt her:<note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> To ſay with <hi>Iob,</hi> though thou kill me, yet will I truſt in thee againſt all the terrors with which thou affrighteſt me: I ſay, it is the Lord who only can turn the heart to be wiſe to ſalvation: And to be ſure, as it ſhould humble all ſuch cavillers, (who are alway proudeſt of that wit which damps them moſt) as feele this nature unſubdued in them; ſo it ſhould raiſe up a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſpirit of thankefulneſſe in all them, whom God hath pluckt out of all ſuch ſnares, cauſing them to turne their Satyrs into ſongs; and their invectives into admirations: and to bleſſe him, who hath put their ſoules out of thoſe queſtions, which (if they were now to reſolve) the greateſt queſtion would be, whether ever they would be reſolved. This I have briefly ſaid of this point generally; whereof much more might have been ſaid, ſave that my text pitches my thoughts upon the ſpeciall cavill of <hi>Naamans</hi> carnall reaſon; unto which I haſten, hoping that in this inſtance I ſhall ſatisfie them, who are deſirous to heare more of the generall.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point then out of this anſwer of <hi>Naaman</hi> is this:<note place="margin">Carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to faith.</note> That car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> reaſon is a great enemy to the ſoule, in point of aſſenting and cleaving to the truths of the word. So it was here to <hi>Naaman,</hi> and ſo it is to all, who leane thereto. For the better conceiving of which point, firſt in a word, I will ſhew what I meane by carnall reaſon, what ſorts of men, and in how many reſpects and inſtances it reſiſts the word. Secondly, I will prove the point by Scripture and ſundry reaſons: And laſtly, come
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:45715:118"/> to the uſes, and therein anſwer one maine queſtion, how farre forth mans wiſedome may be admitted to have any thing to doe in the matters of God.<note place="margin">Carnall reaſon what.</note> For the firſt, by carnall reaſon, I meane not the power of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning according to rationall and ſenſible grounds; nor yet the exerciſe of that power, in ſuch things as are objects of reaſon, I meane humane matters, which ſenſe can judge of. For to deny ſuch things, were to make men meere idiots, and to diſable them from capableneſſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: But I mean that carnallity of reaſon, which judges and diſputes according to ſinfull, corrupt and depraved reaſon, and calls Gods holy and myſticall truthes, (which are onely judged of by a ſuperior power of ſpirituall reaſon and underſtanding) to the barre or ballance of an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,<note place="margin">See 1 Cor. 2.15.</note> that is an inferior and diſabled reaſon and judgement, which hath loſt the the gift of diſcerning truthes, by the error and corruption of old <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Three ſteppes of carnall reaſon.</note> Now this erroneous judgement hath three ſteppes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: For firſt, carnall reaſon buyes and ſells God and his actions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to the meere proportion and ſcantling of outward appearance, and weighes him ſo juſt in her ballances, that ſhe will abate him no one dramme of weight in the reckning; but he muſt be juſt the ſame, not one haires bredth under or over,<note place="margin">Pſal. 78.19.</note> then ſhe allowes him. Thus the Iſraelites when they were in the wilderneſſe, becauſe they ſaw no reall ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or meanes, of a ſupply of meate and drinke, deny it poſſible that they ſhould be furniſhed at all, concluding that they muſt of neceſſity periſh. Can the Lord (ſay they) ſpread a table in the wilderneſſe? They would allow the Lord no more power, then the meere poſſible or probable meanes would afford. This is carnall reaſon in groſſe; ſomewhat like the groſſe condignity of Popiſh merit. This was <hi>Naamans</hi> reaſon here in the Text.</p>
               <p>A ſecond ſteppe is, when although light out of the word, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> convincing experience dare not confine God ſo cloſe, nor girt up his power ſo narrowly, but hee muſt have a power beyond any thing which appeares; yet for all that, in ſecret ſhe thinkes it very meet, that God ſhould tye himſelfe and yeeld of himſelfe to worke by rationall and likely means; and when he doth ſo, ſhee is beſt ſatisfied, and ſtumbles when it is not ſo:<note place="margin">Luke 7.4.5.</note> Thus the Jewes thought it a very meete con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity that Chriſt ſhould heale his ſervant, who had built them a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and loved their nation, as if Chriſt were tyed in doing miracles to gratifie his benefactors: and ſo his mother herſelfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.4. when ſhe ſaw they wanted wine, would needs foreſtall him, ſaying, Sonne thou canſt doe a miracle, and thou canſt not doe it at a better ſeaſon then now, to ſupply their want of wine; as if our Saviour ſerved onely to attend mens opportunities by the power of his Godhead! indeed hee did the miracle, but not upon either the ground or end which ſhe framed: This <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is a dreg of the former. The third ſteepe is, when we confeſſe God and his will and power above all, and confeſſe it muſt be hee onely which muſt worke all of himſelfe, and is above the meanes: but yet in the uſe of meanes we expect God ſhould not fruſtrate us, but worke by and through them; not remembring that as in the firſt, the Lord is tyed to no meanes: and in the ſecond, he is a free agent and is above all meanes: ſo in this third, he can worke aſwell without the meanes, and againſt them,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:45715:118"/> as with them: and uſeth meanes onely for other cauſes, not for his, but our better helpe and convenience. So that this baſe carnality plaies her priſes one way or other, and dares act her part upon Gods ſtage; ſo that no one myſtery, adminiſtration, worke or ordinance of his can paſſe her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> fingers, without ſome verduit or other of her owne, ſhe will have an oare in every boate.</p>
               <p>In this firſt branch I would further have it conſidered,<note place="margin">What ſubject carnall reaſon dwels in?</note> in what ſubjects or perſons I conceive this carnall reaſon to reſide, when I ſay, it is an ill judge, and a great enemy to the matters of God. I doe not here intend Atheiſticall reaſon, ſuch as that of the Epicurean ſect was, who thought the world to be eternall, both before and after, becauſe there could no reaſon be given how a workeman could atchieve it, or perfect it: where (ſay they) are his tooles, his leavers, his hammers for the nonce? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meane I the carnall reaſon of prophane <hi>Eſau's</hi> and libertines, whoſe belly, backe, pride and eaſe of the fleſh, wholly ſway them, and who have daſhed out that dimme light of morall or naturall notions left in our decayed nature (through the prevailing of their luſts:<note place="margin">Even profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>) but I meane them who ordinarily profeſſe Religion, whoſe knowledge of Religion added to their naturall light, doth curbe and over-rule in good meaſure the exceſſe of carnall reaſon in her groſſeneſſe: For why? Education, training up to knowledge, and obſerving of truthes taught in the word, will eaſily moderate the baſeneſſe of this carnality; though grace and ſanctification hath not yet ſubdued, either their mindes to the true ſenſe, or their hearts to the ſavor of Gods matters, as in the regenerate. Nay further, I would have all to conceive the doctrine in generall, as belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to all carnall reaſon without exception, whereſoever it bee found; inſomuch, that the very godly themſelves, (ſo farre as unregenerate,<note place="margin">Yea the godly themſelves in part.</note> and eſpecially Satan by infidelity tempting them) are carried this way dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly: as thoſe many inſtances of Scripture of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of <hi>Samuel,</hi> of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,</hi> of <hi>Sarah,</hi> of others, witneſſe, who when they heard of,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.6. Num. 20.10. &amp;c.</note> or went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Gods meſſages or matters, preſently they cavilled by carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſaying, Should all the flocks of the mountaines, or heards of beaſts be ſlaine, to feed this people? Should <hi>Sarah</hi> at this age give ſuck? If the Lord be with us, why are theſe things upon us? Is not the Lords annointed <hi>(Eliab)</hi> before him? Meaning theſe things to reaſon ſeeme impoſſible, therefore they are ſo; or this or that ſeemes likely, therefore it is ſo: whereas (when they ſpeake as beleevers) they looke at another principle, thus or thus God will, or will not have it, therefore ſo it is and muſt be: God will and can doe this or that, therefore done it ſhall bee, whatſoever fleſh cavills to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Ere I leave this firſt generall, I will adde ſome inſtances of Gods mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Inſtance. </seg>1</label>
                  <note place="margin">Worſhip of God.</note> wherein carnall reaſon prejudicateth and hindreth the ſoule from conceiving and beleeving: For although I might onely ſpeake in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and ſay, it hinders in all both morall (eſpecially if truly underſtood, as the hallowing of a Sabbath, the ruling of the thoughts and affections in ſecret) and eſpecially myſteries revealed in Chriſt: yet it will better ſatisfie the minde of you that heare (beloved) to name ſome ſpeciall branches, by which carnall reaſon may be gueſſed at in other kindes. The inſtances are theſe. Firſt, in matter of Religion and worſhip, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:45715:119"/> the ſpeciall wayes of God to us, as in commands, promiſes, threats, or our ſervice to him in ſelfe-deniall, faith, mortification, and the like. For reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and worſhip, how doth carnall reaſon judge? Surely, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of it, which is a powerfull uniting of the ſoul to God, and reſtoring it to the integrity of nature according to creation: But it conceives confuſedly of it, as a due which the creature owes to God, that the inferior worſhip the ſuperior, never looking either at the right maner, or true ends thereof. And therefore, although it grant a worſhip, yet it judges of the frame thereof, according to the patern of corrupt reaſon, and thinkes that God is beſt pleaſed with a blindneſſe of devotion, a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious zeale, ſuch a worſhip as aſtoniſheth the ſenſe with ſome carnall abſtinences, rites, or ceremonies of mans deviſing, or ſome outward pompous rites, and glorious ſhewes of Pietie, in decking of Churches, in golden and ſilver ornaments, precious veſtments, coſtly Temples, and rich furniture: But as for ſpirit and truth of ſoule, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord purely in thoſe ordinances which himſelf hath invented, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſenſeleſſe thereof. As we ſee in Popery at this day, to what point it hath brought the worſhip of God. That worſhip which bites not the Spirit, is moſt ſpecious to the eye, working upon the carnall part, and putting it in hope that God will bee as well pleaſed with her ſervice, as ſhe her ſelfe is, that agrees beſt with carnall reaſon. That preachers ſpeake ſmooth, quaint, pleaſing things, tickle the eare, diſpleaſe not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: That the Sermon be ſhort, and of quicke diſpatch, that we cope all our Sabbath devotion, yea all our religion within the Church walls, and ſavour little of it within our owne houſes, callings and government; but live by compariſon of our ſelves with the prophane, who care for no worſhip at all: this pleaſes fleſh alife.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">For Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</note>So for Commands: ſo farre as they goe in reaſons ſtreame, as to live and be painfull in our callings, to beware of bringing our names into diſcredit by lewd company, drinking, ſwearing, and pot-companionſhip, to keep our ſtate from decay, to be no ſpend-thrifts, and ſo become bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>denſome to our friends, or the Towne. Theſe and the like commands, becauſe they borrow authority from carnall inconveniences, pleaſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reaſon well: But to obey in ſuffering as well as doing, with the loſſe of credit, eſtate, life; to truſt God in all theſe, and live by faith, that God will ſupport us in our endevours, this is fooliſhneſſe to carnall reaſon. A man who ſuffers for the ſafeguard of his conſcience, ſeemes a ſtark foole to a worldling.<note place="margin">Matth. 16.20.</note> Tuſh (ſay men) hee may thanke himſelfe, this needed not to betide him.<note place="margin">For Promiſes.</note> So in the matter of promiſes, carnall reaſon loves to heare that men ſhall fare well for their truſting God, and obeying him: But how? They ſavour no ſpiritualneſſe in a promiſe: So their Cow may not caſt her Calfe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 17.</note> ſo their bellies may bee filled with the treaſure hidden in the earth,<note place="margin">Deut. 33.</note> enjoying the bleſſing and influence of the Sunne, Moone, and heavens, that they may abound in Corne, and Wine, and Oyle, and feele no lack in their health, bodies, names, children: ſo long, I ſay, they are for promiſes: They can alledge, that God hath promiſed no more to drowne the world:<note place="margin">Gen. 8.22.</note> That Summer, harveſt, ſeed time and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt ſhall continue, theſe they lot upon, and ſnatch at: but as for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to eaſe a loaden ſoule, to reſtore to it life and immortality
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:45715:119"/> by the Goſpel: This and the like are gibbridge to them: He that ſhould preſſe them to get the favour of him that dwelt in the buſh, were as one that told them a tale of a tub,<note place="margin">Deut. 33.16.</note> or ſpake in Hebrew and Greeke unto them. So I may ſay of Gods threats: Perhaps in terrible thunder and lightning they wil run into a hole: But they behold no power nor Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of a juſt and revenging God in any of them. For why? Thier ſinne lies deeply bundled up in them, in the bottome of a deluded and ſecure conſcience; and therefore they feare nothing, they are ſetled upon their dregges and a rotten peace: but as for the inſtrument whom God uſeth to denounce threats, him they flye upon, out-face, and beare downe with a ſtout heart, thinking him to ſpeake out of ill will, ſpite and hatred; as <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabel</hi> conceived <hi>Iehu</hi> to be a traytor like <hi>Zimri,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 King. 10.</note> and further ſhee looked not. But if the threats of God be ſo terrible, that they pierce, or bring ſome reall judgement after them, then the beſt fruit is, ſome bodily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement and bowing like a bul-ruſh; no meeting of God, nor preparing to meet him with true contrition and faith: and ſo the threat ſtill hangs upon record, and is not prevented, as we ſee in <hi>Ahab</hi> his caſe.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Inſtance. </seg>2</label> ſecond then may bee, in the providence and adminiſtrations of God:<note place="margin">Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God.</note> wherein the judgement of carnall reaſon is this, That if the morall and vertuous be bleſſed, and fare well, and the vitious be puniſhed,<note place="margin">Eccleſ 9.11.</note> if race be to the ſwift (as the wiſe man ſpeakes) and battell to the ſtrong, and wealth to the provident, and poverty to ſuch as ſtruggle not for the world, if the good live long, and the bad be ſoone diſpatcht; then they feele their bloud to run right in their veines, God is alive, and judgeth the earth: But if God vary from their courſe, and they meet with darkneſſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion, that Princes goe on foot like Lackies,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.</note> and Peſants ride on horſebacke &amp; be exalted, if the righteous <hi>Abel</hi> periſh in his righteouſnes, and <hi>Cain</hi> prolong his dayes, if the malicious proſper as a greene Bay tree,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.</note> and the like: Oh! then God is not ſo wiſe as hee might be, here they are puzzled, and at a non-plus, they fall and breake their ſhins at this thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold: then they cavill, and thinke they may juſtly chalenge him; nay more, they thinke with them in the Prophet,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.</note> they have ſerved God in vaine, and waſht their hands in innocencie to little purpoſe: for the bad are at as good termes with God as the good, and ſo they wax careleſſe, prophane, diſtruſtfull and diſſolute, as if there were no God.

               <p>A third inſtance may be in Croſſes which God diſpenſeth ſpiritually, <label type="milestone">

They come upon all alike;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 11. Eccleſ. 9.2.

So when a valiant Captaine attaines great victories, carnall reaſon wonders not, becauſe there is a proportion: But for Rams hornes and pitchers to beate downe walls and armies,<note place="margin">Joſh. 6.</note> it is ſavourleſſe to them. And ſo againe, that which agrees to the cuſtome of the time, and the courſe of the multitude, paſſes for currant with ſuch; but that which they ſee but few doe, they ſuſpect as ſingular and ſchiſmaticall; for they ſtand not to the barre of the word,<note place="margin">Act. 18.14.</note> but the world: As <hi>Gallio</hi> looked at law, and common right betweene man and man, but abhorred all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as faction, ſo theſe: open and noted offenders they ſhunne to be, but cloſely to be falſe, to lye, to doe a man miſchiefe, to be unchaſte, to do evill for evill; they thinke theſe no diſgrace; they feare men, and the loſſe of their favour and repute, they feare no cenſure of Gods eie; to quite themſelves of their enemies, as well as they can, put up no wrongs, to be angry when they are provoked, to ſtrike in anger, to love friends, and hate enemies, this they thinke beſeems them.</p>

And ſo by their unskilfulneſſe either in husbandry, manufactures or traffique, ſpend their own, and their wives portions and childrens meanes, and ſo muſt ſeeke to hide it by travell into another world? Are not our plantations like to take well, if ſuch be the planters? Others although of a loving heart to Gods people, yet wanting diſcretion, ſuffer themſelves to be much overlaid with burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome perſons, which oft cauſeth ſtrife betweene them and their wives, when their ſtates ſinke.

A ſecond, is ſcandall at the power of Religion; Oh! it is a pinch and a checke to their carnall liberties, men
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:45715:130"/> cannot endure ſuch chaines, Pſal. 2. and will have no Lord to curbe their luſts. A third is, offence and ſtumbling at the meanes of Chriſt and Religion: Doe any of the Phariſees follow him?<note place="margin">

My grandfather, father, friends, favour not this way; I ſee it breeds loſſe, danger, trouble and purſuit. A fifth is, the tradition of men: As <hi>Zachary</hi> diſliked to name his ſonne <hi>Iohn,</hi> becauſe none of his family were ſo named; rather they chuſe to be irreligious ſtill, then to change the cuſtome of their forefathers: And the threats of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to their children doe deterre others, ſaying, if I thought thou wouldeſt be one of theſe zealous ones, thou ſhouldeſt not have a foote of my land. A ſixth is, lewd counſell<note place="margin">Lewd coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.</note> of ſuch as egge away the yonger ſort and tell them it is the next way to reproach and beggery. A ſeventh is, baſe flattery of ſuperiors, Oh! there is a ſlaviſhneſſe in ſome mens ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rits, that ſo they may bee taken up with their betters, they will forfeit their Religion; they will loſe God, rather then the company and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the great. An eight is, baſe eaſe and formality<note place="margin">Eaſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality.</note> of profeſſion, it is an Idoll univerſally received, and ſpit out of the mouth of carnall reaſon, the Maſſe (as we ſay) bites not.

               <p>Here perhaps it might be expected, that I ſhould ſay ſomewhat about Jeſuiticall equivocations. But if men of their owne ſide might be heard ſpeake againſt them, Papiſts againſt Papiſt, I need ſay nothing:<note place="margin">Joſephus B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lderus Epiſcopus Antwerp.</note> that in ſuch equivocations the heart thinkes one thing (by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation) and ſpeakes another, and that to deceive: What is lying if this be not? And whereas they ſay, that is for lawfull evaſion: I anſwer, it is indeed for evaſion, but that which is by a lying way cannot be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. A Papiſt is asked, art thou a Prieſt? He anſwers no; hee reſerves this, not a Prieſt of Baal, or not a Prieſt to utter it to thee; herein is a lye both for matter and manner: for matter, in that he utters; for manner, in that he means, that is to deceive. They object, the whole propoſition made both of the expreſſion and ſuppreſſion is true: I anſwer, That only which is expreſſed, is the propoſition, which is a lye; not that which is concealed; if that were uttered, the whole were true, but ſo there were no coſenage. To thinke a truth, which in word they gainſay, is a lye. A lye properly reſpects another; by declaring his minde by words, which ſerve to that end; no man is ſaid to ly to himſelfe, but to another. If I ſhould ſay the fire is not hot, meaning by an heate externall; or a man is no reaſonable creature, meaning as an Angel: are not here lyes? Hee that denies, denies whatſoever is contained under the ſenſe of that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. He therefore, that ſo anſwers and ſweares, is perjured; and ſo all ſound Divines affirm. Let what tricks be uſed, that can be, God takes the oath not as he intends it who makes it, but as he who takes it: oaths muſt go according to the common uſe of men. To ſweare, is to call God as witneſſe in things doubtfull: but who doubts whether a Prieſt be a Prieſt of <hi>Apollo?</hi> Truth is an act of righteouſneſſe, not to be eſteemed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:45715:131"/> but words. See Jerem. 9.8. 2 Cor. 4.2. It is objected, they maintaine not ſuch anſwers alway, but for uſes to ſhunne danger, death, &amp;c. I anſwer, that which is nought, muſt never be done. He that ſaith, I ſaw not ſuch a Prieſt, reſerving in his minde (at Rome or Venice) doth not qualifie his lye, becauſe he doth it to himſelfe onely; another can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apprehend his mixture or limitation: Such therefore are of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his double minded ones: It is objected, that which is concealed, is but onely a deſperate thing, not contrary to that which is uttered. I anſwer, yet it is a lye: for if I affirme that of <hi>Plato,</hi> which is only true of <hi>Socrates,</hi> it is a lye; yea this is a double lye, becauſe it is under the colour of ſimplicity. Againe, an oath is the end of all ſtrife Heb. 6.16. But by theſe oaths, controverſies are never ended, but endleſly multiplied: they object, the judge is incompetent; or they are asked of things under the ſeale and ſecret of confeſſion: but then we muſt not lye, but ſhunne ſuch a judge, or deny to anſwer: for what is ſo falſe, but may be made good, if we may reſerve what we liſt? A written lye, borrowes no truth from him that reads it, nor a ſpoken lye by him that heares it; a lye it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo in the writer and ſpeaker: Truth muſt be to us as <hi>David</hi> was to his ſouldiers, worth tenne thouſand of them; ſo worth our life, goods, liberty and all. The ſpeech of a woman; I will not therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a truth, leſt I ſhould die; but I will not lye leſt I be damned. Tell me, what lawes could bridle lyers, if this courſe were lawfull? How fooliſh were the Martyrs who loſt their life for want of this trick? Whoſe teſtimony ſhould be currant in Court? Theſe equivocators object the lies of the midwives, <hi>Abraham, David, Rahab &amp;c.</hi> But one ſinne excuſes not another. When 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. the Prophet ſaid he came to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, he was not asked the queſtion, he ſpake the truth, but not all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needed he, Chriſt ſeemed willing to goe further, but did not; and why? Becauſe he was diſſwaded by others. Other examples which they bring, are not words which require a reſervation to cleare them from a lye, but have an entire truth in them being aright underſtood. The concluſion is, the trade of equivocation is divelliſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ambition.</note>A tenth is, affectation of honour and preferment, for which it is eaſie to loſe a good conſcience; hee that can loſe a little pompe, may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a great deale of peace. So alſo to end, ſchiſme and ſingularity, theſe and ſuch like,<note place="margin">Schiſme and ſingularity.</note> are oyle to this flame of this corruption; cut theſe off, intercept theſe ſuccours and through mercy this carnall reaſon may be ſtarved and vaniſh for lack of nouriſhment and fewell. But I inſiſt no longer: let this ſerve for the fourth branch, and ſo for the whole uſe of Admonition.</p>
               <p>A fourth uſe may be confutation of Popery: It is a meer dunghill ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <label type="milestone">

Alas! men are weary of ſpirituall worſhip, when they have carnall. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell and his eldeſt ſonne, know well the complexions of carnall people; and when the Goſpel hath beene preached twenty yeare together, yet people will long after the garlick and onions of old Religion, and carnall reaſon with her taile ſweepes downe a great part of the ſtarres of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:45715:131"/> we doe but gugge and tire moſt men with our preaching of ſelfe-deniall and faith: Alas! one carnall Popiſh fellow would draw more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, then tenne Preachers. As one ſaith, The Divell never ſhed drop of bloud for us; yet he boaſteth that he can have ten to one more at his beck then Chriſt. Popiſh Embaſſadours have puld away abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of London profeſſors to their Maſſe; they ſtabliſh their throne upon theſe two pillars of pompe and devotion, both carnall; and by their <hi>Circe</hi> her cup, have made drunken the Princes, Peeres, people of the earth from the higheſt to the loweſt. Thoſe diveliſh devices and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of theirs, their antiquity, univerſality, viſibility, without interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of ſucceſſion, their conſent: Their goodly ſhewes, rich veſtments, ceremonies, golden Temples, Altars, Images, and Crucifixes, their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation of Fathers, patching up old garments, with the ſhreds of mans teſtimonies, have ſet ſuch a flouriſh upon their Religion in the eies of fooles, that they have infinitely ſcrued themſelves into the affections of our libertines and carnall Proteſtants;<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.26.</note> I have touched this point in one ſermon before, I will here be ſhort: As <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith of the harlot, ſo ſay I of all their painted Religion; Hee whom God hateth ſhall bee catcht by her: And it is juſt that ſo many in this land are left to tickle after this Religion of theirs; The Lord leaves them to be deluded here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, becauſe they never cared to receive the truth; to bee gulled with pebles, becauſe they loathed Pearles. And when error hath gotten once into the entralls and bowells, it pleaſeth ſo well, and is ſo rooted, that they hardly returne to their former diet any more:<note place="margin">Gen. 8.12.</note> The Dove cared not for the ſtrait Arke, when as once the face of the earth was dry, and gave hope of large liberty. The onely ſoile for Popery are the looſe moulds of carnall reaſon: There ſhe rootes and proſpers: beſides this, they mightily inſinuate themſelves by carnall reaſon in another kinde. Their great promotions and preferments, which they profer to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, doe mightily prevaile with ambitious mindes, and hath drawne aſide many pregnant wits.</p>
               <p>Another trick of carnall policy in Popery is this, That they have alway <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Inſtance. </seg>2</label> found <hi>Sinons</hi> and factors among our ſelves, to bring in the Trojan horſe among us, under pretence that our Religion and theirs, our ceremonies and theirs, doe not ſo differ, but that wiſe Caſſandrian ſpirits, and men of moderation might reconcile them together. In oppoſition whereof, one of our worthies wrote his Reformed Catholique, and ſhewed, that (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their blanchings) we muſt be as irreconciliable with them as light and darkeneſſe. To this end was that curſed Interim in <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, and <hi>Luthers</hi> time, even to eate out the marrow of the Goſpel, and to choake all that were unſound at heart. The like to which, was that Poſſiack Synode in France; and ſtill to this day, doe they keepe their poſſeſſion among us, by the mediation and negotiation of ſuch agents of theirs who (abhorring the power of truth) uphold Popery by their diſtinctions, and by conſorting and complying with the Papiſt to the uttermoſt, that he may be pleaſed, whoſover is wronged. And thus the cauſe of Chriſt from age to age loſeth ground, and Popery enlargeth it ſelfe, as the ſea incroaching upon the ſhore. As our worthy Martyr <hi>Iohn Rogers</hi> once told thoſe Anglo-Germane exiles, if they ſtill reſolved
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:45715:132"/> to maintaine this Popiſh Pandora, and not to eſtabliſh pure worſhip, abandoning their traſh and formalities, all would goe to wreck, ſo wee finde it.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Inſtance. </seg>3</label> And thirdly, herein they concurre with carnall reaſon, that from her they borrow helpe and aſſiſtance to their Religion; as if God needed ſuch art and skill of man, to further his deſignes. As for example, To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke men to mortification from the world, they exhort them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce commerce with men, and betake themſelves to a Cloyſter. To draw men to chaſtity, they perſwade them to vow abſtinance from marriage. Sundry penances they lay upon the bodies and purſes of men, which though God never appointed, yet they ſay, it is impoſſible other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to prevaile againſt the invincible ſenſuality of men: Spirituall mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyings being ſo difficult, that they ſee few will apply them, they are compelled to deviſe carnall, and ſuch as border upon the fleſh: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they want not the example of many of the Fathers, who often ſtretch a joynt, and goe againſt the expreſſe Scripture, when they would perſwade any difficult duty, by adviſing policies of their owne, to eke out the infirmity (as they thinke) and penury of divine perſwaſions. As <hi>Origen,</hi> notwithſtanding all his Allegories of the text, yet made a groſſe and literall conſtruction of that text concerning Eunuches; making himſelfe one corporally, for the deſire he had of virginity: But ſuch tricks and devices of men the Lord abhorres: I confeſſe that himſelfe for a time permitted a pedagogy under the law, (when the light of truth was dimme) conſiſting of ſuch carnall rites and abſtinences, clenſings and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations; but withall he confined them to their ſpace and period, and meant not to have his Goſpel and the cleare ſunneſhine thereof to bee darkned with ſuch blinde devotions of ſuperſtitious brains: No, Gods art is able to invent waies often times more efficacy then ſuch as theſe, which indeed have a ſhew of Religion, in not ſatisfying the fleſh, but are brought in to oppoſe the power of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Col. 3. ult.</note> who is a ſtronger man to caſt out Satan, then he is to hold his poſſeſſion: But Satan will never caſt out Satan, for then could not his kingdome endure. I conclude therefore upon theſe grounds, that till carnall reaſon and religion can be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, (which is as hard as to yoke the Unicorne to the plow) Popery and Chriſtian Religion cannot ſtand together. So much for this third uſe.</p>

In the ſufferings I have had, how doe I ſeeke rather to licke my ſelf whole by outward helpes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, then by that hundred fold which thou haſt promiſed to requite my loſſes withall?

Oh! yee Headburrowes, and Officers of Townes, let this truth of God convince yee: how doe you looke at pleaſing men, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> ſhunning ill will, aiming at ſerving your owne turnes and baſe ends, rather then at diſcharging duty in puniſhing offenders, both ſpirituall upon the Sabbath, and morall at other times, deſpiſers of the ordinances, ſwearers and drunkards? Is not this carnall wiſedome? elſe know not I what is. Alas! where is <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirituall reaſon, that bleſſed God for giving him an heart to build a Temple, and prepare ſtuffe for it, although it were the lot of <hi>Salomon</hi> to have the name of it? So God had it, how little cared he by whom? So Chriſt were preached, how little did <hi>Paul</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, or care by whom? And ſo againe, what is the common ſpeech of men? If I had ever hurt him, it would not have grieved me to bee ill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> ſpoken of, or dealt with by him. But alas! thou haſt more cauſe to bleſſe God for thy breaſt-plate of innocencie to ſhrowd thee from God his revenge. Thou ſhouldſt ſee God rather againſt thee for thy little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Majeſty, in the ſincerity of thy ſpirit, then at man whom thou haſt not offended. So againe, how oft have our carnall hearts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded themſelves upon Gods adminiſtrations, to cenſure him for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> long ſuffering of the bad, and the croſſing of his owne in their zeale and good cauſe? Ah, poore worme! canſt thou comprehend Gods ends in thy fiſt? How doe wee Miniſters murmure and complaine, if wee doe no good? Why? are we above election, or ſervants to it?

He had long jangled and cavilled with God, alledged for his owne innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and ſeemed to call God to the Barre of his owne carnall reaſon And as his freinds one way had cavilled againſt his uprightnes, by the miſery that was upon him: So he on the contrary, cavilled againſt the juſtice of God, by juſtifying himſelfe. But the Lord approved neither of both, but ſent <hi>Elihu</hi> to be a moderator between them: And the Lord ſteps in him ſelfe, and convinces them both; till at laſt <hi>Iob</hi> yeelds with confuſion of face, and comes in with abhorring himſelfe, and ſilence. Oh! this is (up and downe) our baſe ſpirit: we have long lived in an habituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting of God, not onely in his croſſing of us, but in his ordinary wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king toward us. Oh! how ſhould it humble &amp; tame us! Oh! how ſhould we abhorre our cavilling ſpirits! The very Papiſt himſelfe is not more carnall then our ſpirit is: They cavill againſt a ſpirituall preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, and plead the words <hi>(Hoc eſt corpus)</hi> tooth and naile: They cry, Is it not the word, the very Text? (They can cleave to the Text when it ſeemes to ſerve their turne, but elſe they make it a noſe of waxe) And how eager are we againſt them for it, calling them Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaits and Carnall? But meane time wee ſee not that carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon within our owne breaſts, which fights againſt Gods ſpirituall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and adminiſtrations. We cavill ſaying, If God were as hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:45715:135"/> wee ſhould heare ſome reall voice from heaven, or ſee ſome glimſe of his preſence in an outward manner: Surely hee would declare from heaven who are for him, and who againſt him:<note place="margin">Carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wiſhes old waies in ſtead of a promiſe.</note> His enemies ſhould not flouriſh and have their wills as they have, Goates ſhould not trample upon ſheep, ſurely he would judge the world in equity, &amp; not ſuffer things to be ſo darkely carried. Indeed we have the word, and his promiſes ſounding in our eares, and his threats, but he followes them not really, with bleſſing the godly, nor deſtroying the wicked. Oh! thoſe were happy times, when the high Prieſts Ephod anſwered caſes, when God ſpake with voice and by miracles, viſions and Prophets! This ſcurfe is lodged in our boſomes, and we little ponder that, Heb. 1.1. that now God ſpeaketh by his ſonne; as if he ſhould ſay, this manner of his revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelfe, exceeds all other to a beleeving ſoule. Faith can make a reall preſence (though no carnall) both in ſacrament and in word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and in croſſes, and in the moſt hidden adminiſtrations of God in the Church: But it is this curſed carnall reaſon, which darkens all, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes every object to be like the glaſſe through which we behold it.</p>
               <p>To returne therefore, if thou have beene a man given to thine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, put thy knife henceforth to thy throate, and ſtand not to defend or maintaine it againſt the Lord: Beſtow no more wit to cavill, but fight againſt thy infidelity: <hi>Sarah</hi> laughed behinde the doore at the meſſage of the Angel, but ſhe was aſhamed of it,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> &amp; ſhe is ſaid by faith to conceive ſeed, ſhe had caſt out carnall reaſon, ere ſhe could breed by the promiſe. If thou ſee a difficulty in the promiſe which thou canſt not match, yet turne thy ſtruggling againſt thy ſelf, and give glory to God in ſhaming thy ſelf, that ſo thou maieſt give him more in beleeving. Oh what ſhould it boot me to heare men ſay, I have as morall a people as any are; except it may be added, as ſpirituall alſo, what joy can be? morall and carnall civility, and rationall Religion may well agree: truly this taint is deeply feſtred into moſt of us:<note place="margin">You of this congregation looke to it.</note> No congregation (for this fifty years) hath been ſo beaten and ſtaved off from carnall reaſon, a life of ſenſe, and unbeleefe as this; and therefore looke to it, Satan will more rejoyce in your fleſh, then in any other: if he can rule in you by the ſcepter of carnall reaſon (as truly he doth in moſt of us) Oh! how will he crow upon his dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, and exalt himſelfe above the truth of God ſo long preached!

He enlightens every one that comes into the world with true light, being that light which the ſoule muſt come by to the Father, whoſe light cannot elſe be approached: By the fleſh of the Lord Jeſus the ſoule is made capable of this light of the word; elſe there is no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pableneſſe: And the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus workes the ſoule into this light, becauſe it reveales him unto it, in the myſtery of reconciliation and forgiveneſſe: For why? Till the ſoule be made wiſe to ſalvation, all her wiſdome is only in the brain, &amp; will not hold: The Spirit of Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lets into the heart as well as the head of the beleever this light, and conveies the goodneſſe, warmth and ſweet of it, into the ſoule, and that

Therefore apply thy ſelfe eſpecially to ſuch helpes as may bring Chriſt into thy ſoule; The ſight of his ſalvation to thy ſoule is the quinteſſence of ſpirituall wiſdome; this will cauſe thee to grow in all light when once thou art enlightned in the myſtery of acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Chriſt to be thy Saviour:<note place="margin">Ephe. 1.18.</note> For why? This will teach thee that Chriſt is all godlineſſe in a myſtery; all the whole truth of God is lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up in him, as his infants body was lapped up in cloaths and ſwath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands: Elſe all knowledge is but a gueſſing and conjecturall thing: count it then thy chiefe wiſdome to be wiſe in eſcaping the ſnares of death, and in beleeving unto ſalvation: Oh! who ſhall bring me where I ſhall heare a Sermon of Chriſt, to pardon me, to reconcile me to God! If faith in the Lord Jeſus once turne thy ſtream, and carry thee with a fuller ſway to heaven, then all thy worldly wit carried thee before, to thy ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills and objections, there is hope, thou haſt well quitted thy ſelfe of carnall reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Faith the true eye to behold the myſteries of ſalvation.</note>Fifthly, looke with the eye of faith into all the myſteries of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to beare downe carnall reaſon: No myſtery can be underſtood without faith. The Spirit of God workes faith firſt, as that inſtrument, whereby the ſoule is led into all the ſecrets of God: Faith by a promiſe will make carnall reaſon ſtand by as a very foole. Hence it is, that the ſpirituall man is ſaid to judge all things, even the hidden things of God: And yet to be judged of no man:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.</note> Why? Becauſe the light of faith, is the higheſt light: All other lights are of a lower kinde: And hence it is, that a carnally wiſe man comming to heare a poore ſoule to ſpeake (by the light of faith) touching the matters of God, ſtands as a man aſtoniſhed, and as a foole in the preſence of a wiſe man. For why? The Spirit which revealed the promiſe of ſalvation, reveales therewith all other promiſes, and all parts of the will of God: So then, I ſay, in the fifth place, let faith ſubdue thy reaſon, and ſhew thee a reall ſenſibleneſſe, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and wiſdome in all the matters of God: By her eye, judge of the Sacraments, diſcerne the reall preſence of Chriſt there, (though not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carnall) behold a ſacramentall union betweene him and the Elements, for the carrying of the ſoule into an union with him and all his graces: Faith in the promiſe of the ordinance, will as well give thee a ſpirituall ſavour in Chriſt ſacramentall, as ever it did in thy reconciliation: Both being planted upon a word of God, whereto the Sacrament is an inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable and ſure ſeale: Let carnall reaſon judge of a Sacrament, and what will it make of it? A peece of bread, a cup of wine: She beleeves no more then ſhe ſees: What wonder? A man may draw water out of a deepe well without a bucket, as eaſily as a carnall man can gather ſap or ſavour out of the Sacrament, except Chriſt be his wiſdome and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe: Spiritualneſſe in the firſt promiſe, taſted by faith, gives a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to the ſoule in all other parts of the word: And ſo I might ſpeake of each part of ſanctification. Faith onely can get a ſpiritualneſſe out of each promiſe of God, to purge the ſoule of her corruptions: To guide
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:45715:137"/> her in her way: To anſwer her doubts, her feares, her objections: To ſupport her in her croſſes and ſtraits: To ſeaſon her bleſſings, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her unblameable untill the day of her ſalvation. A carnall man ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours no more of theſe, then a dog ſavours a chip; for he wants that whereby ſuch priviledges are ſpiritually revealed. Shee harkens not to the word, (as the Pilot neglected <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 27.) But <hi>Paul</hi> had the revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the ſafety of the ſhip which the Pilot wanted, and therefore ſlighted the Pilots judgement farre more then he could doe <hi>Pauls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, I exhort thee to ſavour ſpirituall things,<note place="margin">Savour ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things.</note> and to be able to prove thou doſt ſo, and that thou art made truly wiſe for ſpiritualneſſe. <hi>Queſt.</hi> How may I prove it? <hi>Anſw.</hi> By theſe few markes. Firſt, ſuch Sermons, Ordinances, Miniſteries, as ſavour moſt of ſpirit and life, affect and enſue; ſuch as ſavour of fleſh and baſeneſſe, forme and carnall reaſon, reject and deteſt: Read and heare the word, with ſeeking out the true ſcope and true ſavour thereof, prying into it, as the Cherubins into the mercy ſeat, not reſting in the barke and ſurface: Bleſſe God for any wiſdome to weigh and judge aright of holy things, and their difference; cleave to a ſpirituall worſhip of God, and abhorre a carnall ſerving of God: Heare the word with humility, faith, attention, obedience; for to the humble and trembling at his word God reveales wiſdome, Pſal. 25. Eſay 28. Prepare thy ſelfe reverently to the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with faith, repentance, love and hunger: whatſoever ſavours of fleſh, as pride, pompe, eaſe, ſelf-ends, world, pampering of the body, ſuſpect it not to be from God. Learne with <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. to accept Chriſt according to ſpirituall, not carnall reſpects. It is death to the ſpirit to be carnall, or the fleſh to be ſpirituall, but to the ſpirit, it is life, Rom. 8.</p>
               <p>Secondly, love ſimplicity: It is a companion of ſpiritualneſſe;<note place="margin">2. Love ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity.</note> get the one, and the other will follow. Affect not a ſubtill, overreaching, cloſe and worldly-wiſe converſation. It will juſtly cauſe Gods people to ſuſpect thee: Let not a double, winding, ſhifting heart and practice be found in thee, either to God or man-ward. Wiſdome I diſlike not, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with grace and meekeneſſe, but carnall and politique wiſdome of the world abhorre: we are called Proteſtants, Profeſſors, bee not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be according to our name: let us be without welt or gard, not bordering upon defence of evill, or cavilling againſt the reproofes of the word: Be not ſimple onely in point of Religion, but alſo among the Religious; Be not aſhamed of God, or of Gods faithfull ones, for their meanneſſe. Better is he that walketh in his ſimplicity, then he that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts his way and is a foole. Condeſcend to meane things, Rom. 12. Gods pretious ones come out of cottages, yea ſometime caves and dens of the earth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, labour for heavenly mindedneſſe, Phil. 3. Col. 3.2.<note place="margin">3. Labour for heavenly mindedneſſe.</note> Our converſation is in heaven. Let your affections be above, where Chriſt ſitteth: Reſurrection of the ſoule with Chriſt, and an holy activeneſſe of ſpirit with fruitfulneſſe, is a ſteppe to the ſoules aſcenſion with Chriſt, and converſe with God. This world full of carnall occurrences of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, pleaſures, companies, earthly courſes and delights, will make the moſt ſavoury Chriſtian forget himſelfe, without great grace. Be armed
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:45715:138"/> therefore againſt this temptation: Know theſe things well and behold them aright, they are nothing, happineſſe is not in them, they promiſe, but keep not touch; uſe them therefore as if thou uſedſt them not, as wings upward, not as clogs; let them be as water, and grace as oyle, which will ſwimme aloft; paſſe through them as that freſh river is ſaid to goe through the ſalt ſea, without taſte or brackiſhneſſe: If grace bee chiefe, ſhee will be a true moderator betweene theſe things and the world; but if the world be chiefe, ſhee will ſo bribe and bewitch thee, that the beſt things will loſe all ſavour and welcome in a ſhort time.</p>

Yet the Lord Jeſus will not forſake them: They want exceſſe of wiſdome, but they alſo are thereby rid of much carnality, and ſavour of the fleſh; and ſo their enmity to God, is the leſſe. Defects have made many happy; they had periſhed if not periſhed. A reverend man of God, once ſaid, it was well for him he was lame on his hand, for
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:45715:138"/> elſe he had never (in ſhew) beene either Miniſter or Chriſtian. Many husbands who have wives, and wives who have husbands of leſſe preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy and parts then others, let them know, that in this defect, they have a bleſſing, they have the leſſe carnall oppoſition to encounter in each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Divell hath the leſſe colour to tempt them to ſhrewiſh, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented and churliſh behaviour. I know that ſillineſſe is a want in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet I ſay, weakneſſe in parts (if there be any competency of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding) may as ſoone attaine grace, as greater abilities: I dare not ſay, that in ſillineſſe it ſelfe there is any praiſe; for the ſilly lye open a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way to bee ſeduced both by too much credulity, and levity in minde and manners. But this I ſay, if God pleaſe to worke, the fort of carnall reaſon is more weake in ſuch, and ſooner ſhot downe. As I ſay of them whoſe wealth, credit, learning, birth and dexterity is ſmall, and cannot greatly commend them to the world; ſo I ſay alſo of theſe, both the account they are to make to God is leſſe, and their obſtacles to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving are not ſo ſtrong as others. Is it not a cauſe of bleſſing God, that he hath removed thoſe braſen barres which doe ſo hold out faith in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Although then (poore ſoules) ye are ſlighted in the world, yet if ye caſt up your recknings right, you may ſay, Lord ſeeing it is no better, I thanke thee it is no worſe: Except I ſaw more of the witty and wiſe to prove Religious then doe, I thinke it is well enough as it is; I ſee the leaſt dramme of grace is ſo pretious, and great parts doe need ſo great a meaſure of it; I cannot but ſet mine heart at reſt, and content my ſelfe with my portion. I know Lord thou art not an hard Maſter to gather and reape, where thou neither ſtraweſt nor ſoweſt; Thou requireſt no more then according to the abilities thou giveſt; If I have poore gifts, yet I bleſſe thee for fewer lets: In this reſpect, I can digeſt my weake apprehenſion, judgement, memory and parts, and withall the diſrepute of the world; I would not for all the worldly wiſdome of the ungodly, change that ſimple facility of my heart to ſtoope to the word, and to ſubmit to the truths of God.</p>
               <p>So long as I ſee Religion to conſiſt in the denying of ſomewhat,<note place="margin">Religion ſtanus as much in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what as the enjoying of it.</note> rather then in the addition of any thing, I ſhall not murmure, that I have bought ſome vacancy of diſtempers, cavillings and reſiſtings of grace, with the paring of ſome ſuperfluities which may be ſpared, counting them happy deffects, ſince thou wilt have it ſo. I ſee although no excellency of man can reſiſt thee, if thou wilt abaſe it to the ſimplicity of Chriſts, 2 Cor. 10. yet not many ſuch are called, 1 Cor. 1. but rather ſuch as have little to loſe, and are glad that Chriſt will owne them, Matth. 11.6. Mutter not at the worldly wiſe, their portion and jollity, for you know not with what lets they are encumbred. Alas! they muſt firſt conſult long with their carnall wiſdome, and if that gainſay, they muſt obey; and how long will it be ere your ſtout hearts and ſtomacks will come down? God muſt take them as the ſhe-wilde Aſſe in her monthes, when they are in ſtraits, if he will have ought from them: Oh! they muſt have the good will of their jolly and gallant wives, or husbands, or kindred, they muſt conſult with their greatneſſe, and what carnall inconveniences follow the profeſſion of the Goſpel: If theſe conſent nor, they cannot come: If old cuſtomes, gamings, companionſhips, meriments, their proud wives, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:45715:139"/> courſes, great buſineſſe in the world will not ſtand with this ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, they muſt not meddle. <hi>Agrippa</hi> was in more chains upon the throne, then <hi>Paul</hi> at the bar in this kinde;<note place="margin">Act. 26.</note> he was almoſt perſwaded, but his clogs of ſtate and bravery pulled him backe: A world of Lions is in the way, no hope to overcome them.

               <p>Firſt, politicke ſhifting with an officious lye, or an handſome ſudden evaſion, though againſt truth. Thus the midwives made a lye to avoid the murther of the Iſraelitiſh women: True it is, the Lord covered it in mercy, becauſe the ſcope and end was holy, and tending to charity; and it ſaid, the Lord built them houſes, yet not for their lying, but for their mercy. The like I ſay touching the woman that concealed <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> ſaying, They were gone over the brooke, when they were in the Well: So <hi>Rahab</hi> hid the ſpies, and is commended for it, Heb. 11. but not for her lye, ſaying that they were gone. I ſay not, that they ought to have diſcovered them, nor doe I ſay it is eaſie to anſwer the queſtion, what ſhould be done in that or the like caſes (the Lord keepe us from ſtraits and from horned occaſions and hard exigents which are both waies difficult) but I ſay, theſe things are not lawfull, we leave the diſpenſation and iſſue of ſuch things to God, to whom only mercy and pardon belongs, when the ſoule hath offended by a kinde of neceſſity. But to affirme that God may be, or is pleaſed by a lye, or needs it, were horrible. Now then if a ſhift or a lye for a good end, a weighty and holy end, yet cannot be maintained as warrantable, what ſhall thoſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſhifts be counted, which wicked men uſe to conceale themſelves, when their owne lewdneſſe hath brought them into ſtraits? As <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> wives policy to diſguiſe herſelfe going to the blinde Prophet, and making herſelfe another, becauſe ſhe feared <hi>Ahija,</hi> for her Idolatry. So <hi>Sauls</hi> diſguiſing himſelfe when he went to the witch, and making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe another, leſt elſe his wicked purpoſe had been defeated.

Goodneſſe rather deſires to bee innocent with jealouſie, then guilty with diſtinctions. And thus I might bee endleſſe. I conclude, what ever reaſon is carnall, and what ever proceeds thence, word or deed, is earthly, ſenſuall and diveliſh. And ſo much for anſwer to the firſt queſtion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond queſtion ariſing hence is this, whether any policy and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>2</label> wiſdome may be uſed by Chriſtians,<note place="margin">What policy may be uſed?</note> though perhaps there may be ſome appearance of humane mixture in it? Whereto I anſwer, that in ſome caſes it is lawfull for a Chriſtian to uſe ſuch policy, although perhaps to ſome ſimple minded ones it may be thought ſubtilty: for the matter reſts not in the judgement of men (who are ready to cenſure whatſoever they cannot comprehend) but what the word alloweth. For hee is allowed not whom man, but God himſelfe approveth.<note place="margin">Rom. 2. end.</note> And it is an error in many weake ones, that under pretence of ſimplicity of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which God expreſſely requireth of us, 1 Cor. 1.12.) they cry out of all policy, as circumvention and ſubtilty. True it is, this wicked world is full of ſhifts and ſubtilties, and ſometimes Gods people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are too much given to breake their bounds (as I have already ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) but yet, we muſt neither condemne the righteous, nor juſtifie the wicked. The Scripture it ſelfe affords us examples and proofes of the lawfulneſſe hereof: Matth. 10.16. our Saviour tells his Diſciples, he ſent them forth as ſheep in the midſt of wolves; and therefore wills them to be wiſe as Serpents, and innocent as Doves; ſo farre as ſimplicity and pureneſſe will admit, policy is not onely lawfull, but alſo neceſſary, both for the honour of the truth, and the ſafeguard of the godly, their names, eſtates and perſons,<note place="margin">God himſelfe juſtifies poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> as alſo for the countermining and oppoſing of Satans wiles and policies, and the malicious plots of his inſtruments: And the Lord himſelfe doth juſtifie it. For, not onely in extraordinary caſes, as the borrowing of the Egyptians jewells and gold, that they might robbe them by their ſudden departure: But alſo in an ordinary way he allowes policy: For he taught <hi>Ioſhua</hi> policy, Chap. 8. to uſe a ſtratageme and circumvent the men of Ai, by diſſembling a flight: and <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 5.23. bidding him to go againſt the Philiſtins by a way unlooked for. And ſundry patternes we have in Scripture of the practice hereof with com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mendation. The reſpects therefore wherein it is lawfull muſt rather be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by us, then the thing in generall condemned: and they are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when it repugneth not to a word of God,<note place="margin">Upon what tearmes it is lawfull.</note> manifeſt or by juſt conſequence deducted. For whatſoever is againſt the word cannot bee well done, with all the colouring in the world. As for a man in any caſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to ſpeake a direct untruth, or deny a flat truth, cannot but repugne to the word: But in ſome caſes to conceale a truth,<note place="margin">Eſay 8.</note> or forbeare the deniall of an
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:45715:141"/> untruth, agrees well with the word. Secondly, when policy trencheth upon charity, and is againſt mercy, compaſſion, love, good report, juſtice and honeſty.<note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Finally brethren, whatſoever is juſt, good, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of good report,, that enſue, and the God of peace be with you. Thirdly, when it is againſt the glory of God, and the honour of his name, as of our profeſſion and the Goſpel. Doe all, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Col. 3. to the glory of God the Father. In this reſpect (as I take it) ſome of the chiefe Martyrs imitated them, Heb. 11.38. who refuſed to be delivered when they might: not ſimply unwilling to be ſafe: but leſt their eſcape might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be an occaſion of inſulting to the enemy, and an imputation to their cauſe, and a reproach to them for deſerting the truth, whereas perhaps ſetting this regard aſide, ſome private perſons might have fled to one City, being perſecuted in another. For nature it ſelfe ſeekes her owne ſafety; and it is a ſinne to bring needleſſe trouble upon our ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, when the uſing of ſuch policy, ſtands not with the peace of a mans private ſpirit and conſcience, although perhaps it be erroneous in that particular.<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> The reaſon is, becauſe whatſoever is not of faith is ſinne; not onely againſt knowledge, but without knowledge. For as in the former reſpect it is moſt horrible to goe againſt the light, though the world ſhould judge it never ſo glorious and goodly, as Rom. 3.8. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though good ſhould come of it: ſo when the thing is either done againſt light, or doubtfully, (though in it ſelfe the policy may be lawfull, yet) to the doer it is unlawfull and a ſnare; as we ſee in the caſes of ſome weake Chriſtians, that becauſe they did but doubtingly caſt a little frankincenſe into the Idolls fire, (without any purpoſe of worſhip) for the ſafeguard of their lives, although at the preſent they ſaw not ſo much evill in it, yet afterward, ſeeing the diſhonour to God accruing thereby, they were ſo wounded, that they were never well, till they had reverſed their act, and loſt their lives. Still I ſay as before, that we may in ſome caſes of extremity, pitty humane feare or frailty, but that makes nothing for the allowance of that policy.</p>

Firſt aloofeneſſe and carrying of things afarre off, and concealing of a truth, or our ſelves, whether in word guiſe, and ſemblance, act or practice, for good ends, either of obtaining ſome good, or avoiding ſome evill, inevitably like to enſue, upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of ſuch a truth; cannot be unlawfull, ſo there be no direct de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying truth, or affirming falſhood: For the matter is not in this, what error another is neceſſarily brought into, but whether I lead him ſinfully into it.<note place="margin">Joſh. 2.4.</note> Thus <hi>Rahab</hi> in concealing the ſpies by all her skill and policy had not done amiſſe, if ſhe had not uſed an indirect meane alſo to ſave them, to wit a flat lye: (which yet the Lord did mercifully pardon to her) and ſo I ſay of the other examples before mentioned.

                  </gap>ſh the accuſation caſt upon him, but to make a lye in his defence is unlawfull. Speciall is that of <hi>Zedechia,</hi> conſented unto as lawfull by <hi>Ieremy</hi> himſelfe,<note place="margin">Jer. 38.36.</note> where the King (to prevent the ſuſpition of the Nobles, that the Prophet and he ſhould talke of ſurrendring the City) inſtructs him to anſwer them by a concealement of truth, yet with truth. Tell them (ſaith he) that thou beſoughteſt me that thou mighteſt no more be caſt into the dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that was true in it ſelfe; but neither all the truth, nor that which concurred with their thoughts: But yet their error was no ſinne in <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> It is a ſure rule diſſimulation by negative concealement is lawfull, but no ſimulation.</p>
               <p>A ſecond inſtance: It is lawfull for good ends to uſe this policy, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Caſe. </seg>2</label> To offer the object of a thing indifferent (that is ſuch a thing as may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be offered or not offered without ſin) to a bad perſon, who yet is like to accept &amp; make uſe of the thing ſo offered ſinfully: For example, for the freeing of an innocent, my ſelfe or another, from an unjuſt calumny or exception, it is lawfull to aſcribe to a carnall man his uttermoſt due praiſe (ſo I neither lye nor flatter) though perhaps elſe, I ſhould not be forward in praiſing him, conſidering what baſe evills he is fraught with.<note place="margin">Act. 26.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> uſed this policy in praiſing <hi>Agrippa</hi> (a Jew who beleeved <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets) for that particular, and that he was a meet judge in the cauſe; and (for the preſent) taxed him not for his incontinency with <hi>Berenice</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he profeſſedly lived) although perhaps this, by <hi>Agrippa's</hi> ſinne, might poſſibly harden him in his courſe: yet becauſe it had no direct ill on <hi>Pauls</hi> part, and made for a good end, it was lawfull.</p>
               <p>A third inſtance may be this: It is a lawfull policy to uſe the unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Caſe. </seg>3</label> malice or evill in any man to a good end, either mine owne benefit or the good of others, and ſo the indemnity of both: If I would purſue a bad perſon, whom I know (though in other private reſpects whether juſtly or unjuſtly) to be in the diſpleaſure and deepe ill will of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, yet it is lawfull for me to borrow aide of that enmity and grudge of his, for the puniſhment of the offender: Although (were it not in ſuch a caſe) I ought neither to concurre with his diſpleaſure, to aggravate it, or to occaſion his ſinne to rankle in his boſome. An example whereof we have in <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 23.6. who ſeeing the two ſtrong factions of Sadduces and Phariſees bent againſt him to overthrow him, uſed policy to ſet them together by the eares. I (ſaith he) am a Phariſee, and the ſonne of one, and am accuſed this day of the reſurrection of the dead: All this was true, although more was true alſo: But he foreſaw that this ſpeech would ſet a quarrell betweene them, and ſo it did, and thereby himſelfe eſcaped the dint of their fury, and drew the more potent ſide againſt the other from himſelfe. Some might thinke it a ſhift and a ſubtilty not caring what became of others, ſo he might eſcape: But he did lawfully
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:45715:142"/> uſe the unavoidable ſinne in which they both lived, to wit faction and diſcord, (although ſimply it was not a ſinne to hate an hereticke) and which it was not in his power to hinder, for his owne ſafety; he onely ſought (I ſay) to diſunite them juſtly (who were now unjuſtly combined in a bad cauſe) that himſelfe might eſcape.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Caſe. </seg>4</label> Fourthly, it is a lawfull courſe to uſe this policy, to take the bow which a bad man ſhootes in, to outſhoot him, and ſo to put him to ſilence. For why? Herein is no actuall, but an appearing and ſemblable concurrence onely with him in his evill by a ſuppoſition. Thus to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute a Papiſt out of his owne tenets, (though they be nought) as to cut his throate with his owne knife, is not unlawfull. The Papiſts exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vilifies the word written, and the cleaving thereto, and ſaith, it is a noſe of wax, and may be turned any way: But tradition (he ſaith) is ſureſt, and the voice of the Pope determining is certaine: To avoide this error, we urge them with their argument for the reall preſence grounded upon thoſe words (This is my body.) When we anſwer, that although it be the text, yet not the meaning; they inſiſt thus, It is the word of the Text; Is it not the very word? We doe not allow it in their ſenſe: but yet we ſo farre take the generall as granted, that we ſay the reaſon is ſtrong againſt themſelves: for if it be ſo eſſentiall to cleave to the word in one queſtion, why not in all? Thus <hi>Paul</hi> although he doe not teach us to borrow proofes of men to juſtifie Gods truth, which needs them not, yet) to convince the Heathen who acknowledged no other truth, doth alledge their owne writers againſt them, both the Athenians, Acts 17. and the Cretians, Tit. 1. So our Saviour himſelfe, Matth. 12.27. askes the Scribes, If I by Beelzebub caſt out Divells, by whom do your children caſt them out? Many of their children tooke upon them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant, but if they held their call and warrant good, why ſhould they ſo ſlanderouſly accuſe our Saviour for his caſting out, whoſe call (they knew) was more unqueſtionably good? He equalls not their warrant to his, but by a confeſſed thing, he convinces them of that they would not acknowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Caſe. </seg>5</label> Fifthly, it is lawfull in policy to make ſhew of that I meane not, ſo I doe it to a good end, and there be no ſinne in it. As <hi>ex. gr.</hi> I intend not to puniſh an offender in ſuch a courſe of proceeding as I uſe againſt him; yea perhaps, although I would, yet I cannot, nay more, perhaps it were not lawfull: yet for the attaining of a more excellent end, I may make ſemblance of it, threaten him with it, and cauſe it to appeare unto his ſenſe, that I may and will urge it; and all to breake his heart to bring the truth to light, and to turne him from his evill, which elſe (of himſelfe) he would in no wiſe abandon. Somewhat like to this policy, was that fact of <hi>Salomon,</hi> 1 King. 3. to the two harlots: When the queſtion was whoſe the live-child was, (both of them ſtiffely maintaining to be hers) God put this wiſdome into him to call for a ſword, and make them beleeve, he would cleave the child in two: A thing not onely terrible and wrongfull to the true mother, but alſo cruell and unjuſt: But by this meanes he came to diſcover the affections of the naturall mother. But the common courſe of men is, to make ſemblance of ſome puniſhments which (although they are both lawfull and neceſſary, yet) out of baſe
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:45715:142"/> Pitty or cowardiſe, they neither doe nor meane to execute, and ſo harden others in their ſinne. This is ungodly.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, It is a lawfull policy for us to reſtraine our ſelves in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Caſe. </seg>6</label> of ſome holy endeavours, ſo oft as we foreſee that our ſtanding out to the uttermoſt were like to endanger us wholly, and alſo ſtoppe the courſe of our endeavours in generall. Thus wee ſee <hi>Paul</hi> preaching at Epheſus two or three whole yeares,<note place="margin">Act. 18.</note> contented himſelfe in generall to diſcharge his conſcience, and to inveigh againſt Idolatry; although in ſpeciall he abſtained from oppoſing of <hi>Diana,</hi> &amp; the Idolatry committed with her; becauſe, either as yet he ſaw not the people ſufficiently cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed in that point, or becauſe he ſaw the ſtreame of the City wholly and irreſiſtably to goe that way; and therefore he choſe rather a little to correſpond with the neceſſity of the time, then violently to oppoſe it with the overthrow of his Miniſtery. But this muſt not warrant us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore actually to doe any thing in maintaining the ſtreame of ſuch evills, when we may avoid it. For a negative omiſſion of a thing unſeaſonable and bootleſſe for us to attempt, is not as a poſitive doing of that which might ſnare our conſcience, and ſtrengthen that which is too ſtrong al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. As for example, perhaps in times of perſecution, to forbeare an open inveighing againſt the Maſſe, whereupon both the ruine of our owne perſons ſhould enſue, and no hurt at all done to the Idoll, (except we could prove our ſelves called to it) were moſt frivolous: And yet we ought elſe to give no negative allowance to evill: But becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in wiſdome truſt God for protection in oppoſing of the ſtreame when danger is unavoidable, therefore we are not called to it: To ſerve evill times is policy; to ſerve the evill of them is treachery.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, It is good policy to keepe our ſelves within the compaſſe <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Caſe. </seg>7</label> of our owne places; and not to ruſh our ſelves under colour of zeale be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our bounds. As for example, It is not meet that monuments of Idolatry be retained in any Church, as Popiſh Images and other ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious markes; and if they be within our owne power and authority, we ought our ſelves to deface them and aboliſh them, as we ſee, Deut. 7.25.<note place="margin">Deut. 7.25.26.</note> But to ruſh out of our owne places and callings without publique authority or ſufficient warrant and ſafety, to attempt the defacing of them in an open manner, where our privateneſſe cannot extend, were fooliſh, and a raſh caſting of our ſelves upon danger not eaſily remedied. In ſuch a caſe, the Lord holds us excuſed, when we doe that which lyes in our private power to doe by mourning, prayer, and abſtaining from the leaſt concurrence of evill, though we proced no further: If we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile not, then to reſt patient, bearing that which we cannot reforme. In both theſe two latter reſpects, to be over juſt, and over buſie, is not lawfull, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, Eccleſ. 7.15.16.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It is lawfull for the avoiding of a ſlander and imputation caſt <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Caſe. </seg>8</label> upon us, and the purchaſing of ſafeguard and credit to our perſons, (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if publicke) to doe that which otherwiſe we would not, and wherein there is ſome inconvenience, ſo there bee no direct evill in it. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 21.24. was perſwaded (though ſome blame both him and them that ſet him on worke) and that ſafely to purifie himſelfe, and take upon him a vow, as being a ceremony impoſed by God, and then
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:45715:143"/> alſo ſuch an one as had leaſt evill in it, to ſtop the ſlander of thoſe Jewes which accuſed him for an oppoſer of the law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> That ſlander diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled and endangered his perſon among the Jewes: The ceremony therefore having not wholly breathed out her laſt, at leaſt among the Jewes, he was content to yeeld unto. And the like I may ſay of his circumciſing of <hi>Titus,</hi> a thing which he was otherwiſe loath to doe, ſave in the former reſpects, for he knew it might be ſome occaſion on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he other ſide to provoke thoſe Gentiles among whom he had preached the overthrow of <hi>Moſes</hi> his law. And the like may be ſaid of the edict which the Apoſtles made,<note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> and ſent by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> among the Gentiles, who ſtill were peſtred with the oppoſition of Jewes, reſiſting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

The Jewes no doubt, did hereby thinke him to concurre with them in the eſteem of ceremonies; but their error was nothing to him, whoſe end was to confute ſlander, for whenas he came among ſuch as oppoſed the doctrine of Chriſt, by urging the neceſſity of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies he was as ſtrongly againſt them, as he was yeelding in the other, where no ſuch danger was: For, neither was he ſo hot againſt the Jewiſh ceremonies, when they were uſed for conſcience by the weake and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and not with oppoſition to Chriſt in the point of ſalvation. Nay rather then, he was all in all to all, that he might win ſome, and gave way wiſely to things not confeſſedly abrogated for a better end.</p>
               <p>And to theſe inſtances many more might be added, but I ſee the time (beloved) is more then paſt. The concluſion of all is, let us abhorre all falſhood and ſubtilty, let us try and examine the colours of good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, let us keepe that which is ſound, and abhorre that which is contrary, ſuſpecting alway our baſe nature, which ſeekes her uttermoſt liberty, and through ſelfe-love eaſily beleeves that to bee warrantable which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. And ſo joyning an equall caution, the ſimplicity of Doves with the wiſdome of Serpents, &amp; wholly reſigning up our ſelves to be guided by God, and not ſeeking our ſelves, the Lord will mercifully bring us out of both ſides of extremities, Eccleſ. 7.18.19. Which that he would doe, let us begge heartily of him, as all other graces in the name of his Sonne: To whom with the Father and the holy Ghoſt, be all glory and praiſe both now and for ever. And ſo I finiſh this doctrine alſo of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reaſon, the firſt of thoſe points which I propounded to ſpeake of out of this twelfth verſe; purpoſing to proceed in the next Lecture with thoſe that remaine.</p>

The former point was, How full and fertile a baſe heart of unbeleefe is of cavills and exceptions againſt the cleare truth of God. The latter was, carnall reaſon is a great caviller and enemy againſt the word and promiſe. I dwell no more upon either. It is time now for us to haſten forward to the ſecond generall head contained in this verſe: And that in a word is <hi>Naamans</hi> diſtemper upon, both the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of his erroneous conceit, and the hereſay of a new (ſenſeleſſe to his reaſon) and unlooked for direction. In this ſecond generall, (through providence) we will inſiſt in this order: Firſt, enquiring into the roote of this diſtemper of his and diſcontentedneſſe: Secondly,<note place="margin">The Second generall head <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

To leave the latter to his place, and come to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: The roote of his diſtemper, was a maine error or miſtake of the Prophets meſſage, and a falſe opinion of his owne way of curing: If this had not beene, all his pudder had beene ſpared: If he had but admitted one true principle before hand, that God muſt be left to his owne way and courſe of working a miraculous cure, and it is not a meete thing that man ſhould be both chapman and cuſtomer, to pitch his owne price
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:45715:144"/> upon Gods commodity or binde God to his owne invention, but leave him to worke freely as him pleaſeth, being glad that he will worke any way for the releefe of a poore diſtreſſed creature: I ſay, had <hi>Naaman</hi> but ſtooped ſo low as to ſuffer free mercy to utter it ſelfe freely and beene thankefull for it too; all this diſtemper of his, (which doubtleſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it ſelfe in more paſſages then the text mentions) might have all beene prevented: Then his cavilling with the meſſage as fooliſh; then his diſcontented receiving it with wrath, then his proud and coy heart, that could no longer forbeare to waite at the doore, then his ſcorning of the Prophet (as being of a great friend become an enemy) then his flinging away in a mad humour and deſperate rage, (not caring to return home as he came and loſe his labour) then his fiery indignation and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon all the occaſions of his defeate: all and every of them had beene foreſtalled, and he brought on to the cure with eaſe and content. But now we ſee how this one error cauſeth a world of ſorrow, not eaſily redreſſed, except the ſame mercy which this ſilly orphan cavills at ſo much, had even pittied him in his kicking againſt it, and had incloſed him in her armes, and not ſuffered him to be miſerable, who would not be happy. But of that after.</p>

And for the firſt, take theſe texts, Pſal. 73. <hi>David</hi> had forgot his rule, That the wicked though they proſper never ſo much, yea though they live an hundred years,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8.12.</note> yet it ſhall goe never the worſe with the righteous: For a ſinner of an hundred yeare old is accurſed: And there is no diſcovery, either of love or hatred certainly by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adminiſtration. Now what comes of it? Oh! ſaith he, my feete had well neare ſlipt, (nay he had ſlipt indeed and fallen too) I had almoſt condemned the generation of the righteous; hee beganne to bleſſe the wicked, and to wiſh their portion; to be weary of his choice, his hopes, and that he was anointed King. And why? Becauſe the wicked flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed as the greene bay-tree, their paths were anointed with butter, and all proſpered with them? Such a foole, ſo diſguiſed, yea a beaſt in Gods ſight, he became by one error committed in the admittance of a falſe ground; which when once removed, the eclipſe ceaſed, the coaſt waxed cleare againe, and he recovered his former hold againe, as the end of that Pſalme witneſſeth. See againe, Pſal. 43. wherein the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of one principle cauſed <hi>David</hi> to grow into deadly dumps; and that was this, His troubles were ſo long that he beganne to thinke God might repent him of that free grace wherewith he had once imbraced him: This cauſed exceeding diſtemper in his ſpirit, ſo that hee thought himſelfe caſt off: So <hi>Hezechia</hi> in his ſickeneſſe, Eſay 38. So <hi>Ionah</hi> in the whales belly: And ſo the Church in captivity, Lam. 3.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:45715:144"/> thought herſelfe forſaken, and that God had forgotten to be mercifull. Hence the heart grew hardened, the peace of it declined to feare and horror, then the word and promiſes grew unwelcome, then the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces grew unſavoury, then the practice growes ſecure and looſe, and ſo all goes to havocke; which might all have beene prevented if the ſoule had kept herſelfe to the rule, That whom the the Lord loveth,<note place="margin">Joh. 14.1.</note> to the end he loveth them.</p>
               <p>Read moreover, Lam. 1.8.9. where <hi>Ieremy</hi> deſcribes the wofull downfall &amp; ſorrow that Jeruſalem was fallen into, and how ſhe was come down wonderfully by ſteps to the loweſt abaſement: And why? Sure the ſad error lay in the foundation, ſhe thought God would keep cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with her, though ſhe brake with him; ſhe thought that to lye cloſe to God, and keepe covenant was no ſuch great matter, but that ſhe might trie concluſions, and ſo by a little deceitfulneſſe of ſinne the heart grew defiled, the conſcience crazy, the ſpirit hardened by cuſtome, the ſoule impenitent and ſecure, grew to care for no threats, to reject commands, to diſtruſt promiſes; and ſo came Jeruſalem down wonderfully: All which had beene prevented if either ſhe had kept cloſe to the covenant, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented betimes upon her revolt. Beſides, look upon Heb. 3.12. Take heed leſt there be in any of you an evill heart of unbeliefe to depart away from the living God, and ſo wax hardened by the deceitfulneſſe of ſin. How doe many who beginne zealouſly, yet wax weary of weldoing by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill heart? Upon that how doth Satan encreaſe deluſion, and tickle with his temptations? How doth the error of the wicked added thereto, draw away more by example?<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.18.</note> Then perhaps God is patient and ſmites not, ſo that the ſinner thinkes him like herſelfe; then looſeneſſe growes, then a conceit that former practice hath been too preciſe, leſſe will ſerve: Then groweth a mean eſteeme of the word eſpecially, if powerfull and comming cloſe: Then perhaps ſin having kindled thus far, makes the life of faith unſavoury, the baites of ſin ſweet, makes us thinke it eaſie to repent at our pleaſure, and ſo we grow ſome to embrace one lewd pranke ſome another, ſome to take their eaſe, neglect prayer, good company, nible at the Divells baites, pleaſure, company, gaming, petty oathes, dalliance with women, baſe faſhions, to concurre with the world, and at laſt to waſte the conſcience (with <hi>Sampſon</hi> and <hi>David</hi>) ſo farre, that a man is ſnared and growne to a falling ſickneſſe: and cannot recover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: All which might have beene prevented, by holding the rule, keep well while thou art well: Be not weary of weldoing, and the like. It were endleſſe to dwell any longer upon proofes.</p>
               <p>Reaſons are many. Firſt, becauſe Religion is a condition of life, much <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> more warily to be tended and watched unto, then any other buſineſſe whatſoever. Now yet in all other affaires, thus we finde it, yeeld but one abſurdity, infinite many will follow upon it unavoidablely: Take it in the buſineſſe of war; If one miſtake fall out, how many ſad inconveniences follow? Let a beſieger of a City be too ventrous, and what perill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth? How was <hi>Abimelec</hi> ſlaine by a milſtone under the wall? How was <hi>Vria</hi> and other worthies deſtroyed by a deſperate affront made by <hi>Ioab?</hi> How were the Benjamites encloſed betweene the two armies of Iſrael, the one burning their City, the other before their face? How
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:45715:145"/> eaſie is it to fall upon privy ambuſhments ſuſpecting no danger? In point of contention betweene couples in marriage, or partners in trading, or others in worldly buſineſſe, neglect but one rule in marriage to forbeare, and give place to wrath, what a fire is kindled? Neglect but oft reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings betweene men, how endleſſe and confuſed grow the accounts? Admit but one tetch and conceit (without due pondering the matter) and how endleſſe contention followes, blowes upon words, ſutes upon blowes, and the ruine of each other by ſutes: So fares it in all other kindes. Let there be but an error in the digeſtion, and what can mend it? Nothing, the bloud muſt needs be bad, the concoction cannot amend it, and ſo all diſeaſes attend the ill ſtomacke, both in the head and parts of the body: Is it ſo in all things, and muſt it not much more bee ſo in the chiefe affaire of all other, which is the matter of Religion? Muſt not one radicall error there, cauſe an infinite pudder in the conſequences thereof? Yes verily, no remedy of it.</p>

For if true peace in our courſe, attend the cleaving to our rule; becauſe the whole ſafety of it, hangs upon the grounds and directions of truth, which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter life, ſupport, light, and defence to the particular practiſe: how can it chuſe, but that thoſe who warpe from the rule, muſt of neceſſity forfeit peace, and runne upon confuſion? See Gal. 6. He that walkes according to rule, peace ſhall be to him: For when the rule holds entire, it miniſters peace to the ſoule in all her actions, even as a ſound inſide of health in the heart, liver and braine, miniſters content to the body in all her operations. And contrarily, if the rule be broken, it fares with the life, as it fares with the operations of nature, when the inward parts wax diſeaſed; a palſey braine cauſeth the members to flag and hang downe, an ill liver cauſeth the body to ſwell: Even ſo is it with a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all man: All the acts of Religion muſt iſſue from the ſoundneſſe of rule and grounds, if either there be knowledge, or no ſincerity, or if there both, yet ſome maine error creep in between the joynts ſecretly, lo, all the whole life is miſcarried, and thoſe errors which we ſee, may thanke ſome rooted one which we ſee not; becauſe it affords continuall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour unto it.</p>

They bury all their labours and mony in the grave of emptineſſe and vanity:<note place="margin">Eſay 55.2.</note> Their pride and ſelfe-love ſo overtakes them in whatſoever they goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, that alas! they are diſcouraged: They cry out upon God with thoſe hypocrites, Eſay 58. that they have heard, faſted and worſhipped God day by day, time out of minde, but ſtill they come to nothing, they want peace and comfort: And why? Becauſe they carry that within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves which takes up the roome of Chriſt and mercy; they will not feele themſelves orphans and fatherleſſe, but truſt to their owne bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, and luſts, or vanities, or at leaſt ſuppoſed goodneſſe, they will put water into Gods well, and then with this bucket, they will draw up ſome grace: Hence it comes to paſſe, if they meet with deepe conviction out of the word that tries them to the quicke, they are faine to ſhake it off with all violence to ſave their skin whole; hee that will not have a good conceit of them, but reproves them, is counted their enemy: Nay thoſe that uſed all meanes and coſt, to get in a Miniſter into their pulpit, let him but once touch their free-hold, muſt never after looke to have him their friend: once out, and ever out. Oh wofull plague! and yet (marke it who ſo will) Beloved, there are ſome among us who live under our Miniſtry, and will not keepe one day from Church, and yet have the Miniſter of God in ſo deep a prejudice that he loves them not (for no other cauſe ſave that he touches their tender plat when hee little thinkes of it) that from ſeven yeare to ſeven, they live at ſecret oddes with him;<note place="margin">Pritch againſt the Miniſter.</note> they are ready openly to cry out of him that he is their enemy, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not looke too rights upon him. Alas! it is from a roote of Selfe which will not out, in that they have not caſt downe their crowne at the feet of the word, as content to be ſmitten, and to count it balme: Thus, they beare often laying heapes upon heapes, and dye of thirſt: All they doe,<note place="margin">Judg. 15.16.18.</note> they aime at themſelves in it, to get themſelves ſome good opinion by their zeale, bounty, good deeds; and why? The running ſore of Selfe will not be healed, and that cauſeth all to become impure. The encreaſe of the ſpleene is not more apparently the decay of the body, then their error, the cauſe of their not profiting: and ſo by cuſtome they wax hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it, ſo that when they doe perceive it is paſt cure, as they ſay of ſome diſeaſes as that of the lungs, that while they are curable it is hard to diſcerne them, and when they come to be diſcerned, they are paſt cure. And to conclude, all the life of ſuch is but as the ſtopping of a water courſe, which coſts great toile, and yet the ſtreame will have her courſe when all is done.

There is a generation which ſeemes pure in her owne eies, (as ſelfe-deceiving hypocrites) but they are not waſhed from their uncleanneſſe. They are like thoſe Idolls, Deut. 7. whoſe corruption is ſtill in them, till they be quite defaced; no waſhing with doctrine, with meanes upon meanes, no melting, no turkeiſing could do them good till they be defaced. As the houſe of fretted leproſie was paſt ſcraping, it was to be demoliſhed. Theſe types ſerved to ſhew that Selfe of it ſelfe is incorrigible.

               <p>Secondly, till conviction come, ſinne lurkes as a ſnake in her hole. A <label type="milestone">

And the other, Woe be to you Scribes and Phariſees Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites! But then they beganne to bluſter and ſhew themſelves in their colours; which would not have beene, if their outward painted crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching had beene laid in the oile of humbleneſſe indeed. It is true of this ſpawne of ſinne, which <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. ſaith of the whole corruption of nature, That ſinne without the Law is unknowne: But when the Law came ſin revived. When once the power of the humbling Law of God came upon the ſoule, ſoked and confederated with ſinne, as her partner and inmate; then beganne the union betweene the ſoule and corruption to breake, and then beganne ſinne to bluſter and be proud and mad: So is it here. When Selfe is croſſed, and her owne way rejected, ſhe is as proud and mad as <hi>Achitophel</hi> that went away and diſdained and hung himſelfe, becauſe that he was not preferred by <hi>Abſalon,</hi> befor <hi>Huſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If ſuch and ſuch be not in the right way, that be ſo lowly, and ſo full of prayers and Religion, God helpe us! But Oh poore wretches! They domineer in their kingdome, and have none to controll them: outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are painted tombs, and ſeeme to crouch and buckle: But diſcover them never ſo little, and put them out of their way, they are as proud and diſdainfull on the other ſide, and no man can ſtand before their envy. What wonder? There is nothing more humble, low, baſe, double di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, then Selfe in her owne way: But put her out, and nothing ſo proud; bloud, they ſay, out of her veſſell preſently putrifieth: Hold with a Papiſt in his owne courſe, (as alas! ignorance muſt doe ſo!) and what ſhall ye not draw them unto? What may you not have at their hands? They will pull out their very eies to doe you good, they will licke the duſt of your feet: But why?

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:45715:150"/> Thus thoſe in Mica 6. would give God thouſands of Rams, tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand rivers of oile in their owne way; ſo that God would let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in their way, they would fine for their Religion, and undoe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yea offer up their children in ſacrifice: All this was to make God beholding to them, to make all wonder at their bounty; ſtill Selfe lay quiet, and gat warmth in her neſt. But when the Lord comes in with his way, Oh then! when he requires the ſoule to be lowly, when he cries heare O man, what he hath ſaid, and what his way is: Then begins the ſorrow! will ſhe then be ſo zealous to embrace Gods way? No,<note place="margin">Mica 6.</note> then ſhe is ſad, and out of all ſorts, ſhe will doe nothing: See whence all that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of coſt and bounty of impopery hath proceeded; even from mens pleaſing themſelves in their owne way: But croſſe them never ſo little, their almes and good workes periſh in ſullenneſſe of ſpirit, and then all amort: Oh truſt not outſides.</p>
               <p>There be many profeſſors of the Goſpel like to theſe: Hold with them in their way of hearing, of duties, of compaſſion, &amp;c. Oh! you ſhall have them as tame as lambes, they will doe any thing for you: But let the Miniſter deale ſadly with them and ſay, Theſe moralities of yours you ought to retaine, but the other and greater things of the Law you ought not to have neglected; and then ſuddenly they become your enemies for telling them the truth. Take an example or two. In the 14. of the Acts, thoſe men of Lyſtra, were ſo low and baſe, as to ſet up <hi>Paul</hi> For Jupiter, and <hi>Barnabas</hi> for Mercury, to make Gods of men: Thus they could be humble in their owne way to rob God of worſhip: But when the Apoſtles perſwaded them to turne from Idolls, to the true God, Oh then! they were ſoone turned from adoring them, to ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them: So theſe falſhearted Jewes who could outwardly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Chriſt for his miracles, hoping that he would become ſome great man, could ſet him on the Aſſe and proclaime him a King; who yet when they perceived his Kingdome not to be of this world, gave him over and cryed, crucifie him. Beware I ſay leſt we be deceived by ſuch,<note place="margin">See Matth. 21.9. &amp; 27.22.</note> and let us know no pride is like to the pride of a crouching Phariſee: A Monkiſh and Fryer-like votary, hath more pride in his bare necke without a band, and in his ſhirt collar, beggars habit, and ſeeming ſelf-deniall, then all the gallants and ſwaggerers in the world: Oh! try mens ſpirits, ere ye truſt them: If their humility lye in Gods way, then eſteem them; but if it lye in their own way, abhorre it: For Selfe (as the Prophet ſpeakes of thoſe Idolaters) will abaſe herſelfe to hell, and cares not what ſhe doe,<note place="margin">Eſay 57.9.</note> to make her ſeeme that ſhe is not, and to play her parts under a canopy; and the more that ſhe multiplies humilities and abaſements, one upon another, the more ſhe ſeeks to eſtabliſh herſelfe and to eke out her own ſhort gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: A dram of humbleneſſe in a truly broken heart, and in Gods way, will goe beyond all ſuch patchery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this ſhould be Terror to all ſuch Hypocrites, as turn away <label type="milestone">

Note it, there is not an hypocrite or wil-worſhipper, if he be convinced by the Miniſtery to bee upon a bad bottome, but he will condemne that convincer to be proud, cenſorious, uncharitable, factious, none are good enough for them: But

And brethren, if there be any ſuch here, let them beſeech him (who can turne all to the good of ſuch at belong to himſelfe) that he would turne all their rebellion, and pride, and coineſſe, to the glory of his name, and the making of their ſoules doubly meeker and humbler then before; for ſo it is, ſinne is out of meaſure ſinfull, both in guilt and rebellion; but grace is out of meaſure gracious to humble the ſoule for both: elſe the word will prove the ſavour of death.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, ſelfe-humility bewraies her ſelfe by this, ſhe is ſeldome in a frame, but alway in her extremities: obſerve thy ſelfe, and thou ſhalt finde the ſymptomes to follow the diſeaſe of <hi>Naaman:</hi> Thou ſhalt be but off and on, out and in, in thy mood very humble, but by and by, ſtout and coy againe: It is not eaſily for a rolling ſtone to lye ſtill: But a falſly humbled heart, will be alway breaking out.<note place="margin">Prov. 7.11.12.</note> As <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes of a diſtempered woman, ſhee may bite in her froward humors for a while, (as an hot gleame in a winters day) but ſhe is overcaſt preſently, and fills her houſe with clamors and chidings, quarrells and paſſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe is inwardly turbulent: No painted white face doth ſo differ

True it is, ſo hee was: But this was neither the fruit of ignorance properly, nor yet of greatneſſe, (although of both in part) but of that diſeaſe which all of us carry in our boſomes, that is Selfe and ſelfe-love: be wee never ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned to know the truth, or never ſo meane (for poore ones without grace can be as proud as rich) we may bewray this tetch and diſtemper as well as he! well (beloved) now you have the ground, lay aſide deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, and come with meekeneſſe to heare this point, that you may bee rid of this diſeaſe, which though all condemne in <hi>Naaman,</hi> yet few ſee in themſelves.</p>
               <p>The doctrine is plaine: Selfe if ſhe be defeated of her hopes rageth:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Selfe defeated rageth.</note> 
                  <hi>Naaman</hi> whiles he had hopes, is at eaſe and a good point, he waites and is patient; now comes this croſſe errand that turnes him over, as drinke doth a drunkard, now he can hold no longer; his patience turnes wearineſſe, and waxes madneſſe: I doubt not but you ſee the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome; yet I doubt not but you would be glad to ſee it cleared; marke then a little thoſe texts and reaſons which ſerve for it, and ſo lead to the application of it to your ſelves. Take that behaviour of the yong man for one proofe, who comming in a deepe foreſtalledneſſe of conceit to our Saviour, that his caſe to Godward was good, and yet thinking ſo highly of Chriſt, that he could enforme him, thought it not amiſſe to aske, Good Maſter, what ſhall I doe to be ſaved?<note place="margin">Matth. 19.22.</note> Our Saviour to beat downe his courage, ſends him to the Law, ſaying, Keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: He being prepared, and hoping to be riveted into his courſe by the mouth of truth, (as men if they can get but halfe a word from a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of comfort, they are ſafe ever after) anſwers, All theſe have I kept from my youth. Our Saviour not to eſtabliſh any rule (as Papiſts dream) but to quaſh his ſelfe-love, replies, then thou haſt need of an eleventh command to be doing with, ſeeing thou haſt kept the tenne, Goe ſell all, and thou ſhalt have heaven: what a pickle is hee in upon this! Oh (thought he!) this is yrkeſome, this is to beat me off quite, ſurely if it bee thus, I am wrong, and have beene long defeated; my wealth I am loath to foregoe, and therefore he went away ſorrowfull. What is that? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly vexing at his lot, out of love with Chriſt, ſad and diſcontent, fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and diſtempered at the counſell. Another example (for the ground of all reſts upon a fact) may be their practice, of whom we read, Eſay 58. who faſted and ſought the Lord from ſelfe-love, (as appeares by the context) that they might under pretence, pleaſe and flatter themſelves the more in their oppreſſion, and ſtoppe conſcience from biting and ſtinging them. Now when they perceived this was no way to ſpeed,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:45715:153"/> and themſelves would beteame the Lord no other, they fly out intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately and chalenge God himſelfe: Why (ſay they) have wee faſted and thou regardeſt not? Oh! they were ſo madded, that they could have flowen in Gods face! Is this the fruit of all our care and coſt, that wee cannot have thanke? Away ye wretches, ye faſt a meale from ſome meat and drinke, but you have pleaſure within, for you feaſt with your bribery and ſtealth, and exceſſe of covetouſneſſe. Is this a faſt? Doe I regard the bowing of a bulruſh, when as the ſoule is ſurfeted with luſts, and the ſoule is neither afflicted, nor ſeekes reconciliation? No, no, I abhore it. Marke, becauſe they cannot get God to be like them, nor bribe him with all their gifts and gloſing ſelfe-denialls: lo, they fall out with him downe right, and bid him goe ſeeke his ſervice. A third place is yet more evident, Mal. 3. where the Prophet brings in other the like hypocrites to theſe, who had both tried God, or tired him rather, with their abſtinences, and faſtings, not from meat onely, but from many ſinnes, (ſo that theſe were better then <hi>Eſay</hi> his men) but lo, they are croſſed of their hopes, they could not ſpeed of their purpoſe, to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and in high favour with God, ſtill he lowred upon them and would not be friends: And why? Becauſe they did all from a falſe bottome of Selfe, and to a baſe end, to ſteale away favour from God: And what is the iſſue? Surely they cry out upon God, and tell him to his face, that he cannot diſcerne betweene his friends and his foes; he favours them that ſweare and play the Idolaters, as thoſe that worſhip him, and feare an oath: And who will ſerve ſuch a Maſter? But thoſe that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God, and eſteemed rewards, not by outward bleſſings, but that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold of peace and comfort; they cried them downe as faſt as theſe did the Lord, they rage alſo at their lot who fare better then they: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre hither the diſcontent and rage of the Prodigalls elder brother, Luke 15.22. And it were endleſſe to inſiſt in examples: What elſe is the ſcope of that wretched anſwer, I ſaw thou wert an hard Maſter, who reapedſt and gatheredſt where thou ſowedſt or ſtrawedſt not, I ſaw little came of thy ſervice, I therefore buried thy talent, take thine owne to thy ſelfe, and looke for no more at my hands. Even as it fareth with hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, ſo doth it with hypocrites, no longer then their turne is ſerved, do they regard the worſhip of God, for they looke at a vantage, either of ſome outward bribe from God, or to delude conſcience, and when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or not both ſucceed to their minde, they fall off.</p>

Firſt, whatſoever the naturall and proper ſupport of a thing is, if that faile, the thing failes; whether it be a neceſſary or voluntary ſubject. The fire if ye remove fuell, the belly if you deny meate, the flatterer who lives by breath, if ye withdraw coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: So long as their oile laſts, their lampe ſhines, but take that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and it goes out: So doth the hypocrite, when his hope failes, his belly burſts: That phraſe in Mica 6. bewraies them, wherewith ſhall we gratifie the Almighty? As thoſe in the Acts, ſeeing the Divell caſt out of the maid and their gaine gone, and <hi>Demetrius</hi> robbed of his ſhrines,<note place="margin">Act. 16.19.

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:45715:153"/> to thy face. If he had not miſtaken the man, hee had not miſtaken his marke.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that effect which commonly followes a leſſer cauſe in a <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>2</label> ſmaller degree, followes a greater in a fuller degree. <hi>Salomon,</hi> Prov. 13.12. tells us, That the deferring of the hope, is the fainting of the ſoule. By the ſame reaſon, the defeating of the hope, muſt needs be the vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, looke what we ſee to fall out in meer naturall diſappoints, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>3</label> muſt needs much more befall in ſpirituall: For the more deſirable the object, the greater is the coveting, and the ſadder the diſappoint. Now this fury and madneſſe is common in naturalls. <hi>Athalia</hi> being defeated of her ſonne, riſes up and playes the mad tyrant,<note place="margin">2 King. 11.1.</note> and deſtroyes all the Kings Seed (though in a ſort ſhe tooke this opportunity:<note place="margin">Act. 12.</note>) So <hi>Herod</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defeated of the wiſe men, ſlew all the males at Bethlem: much more then in ſpiritualls.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that which is ſeene in ſpiritualls of inferiour nature, much <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>4</label> more appeares in an higher nature, when men are defeated. <hi>Ionas</hi> in a caſe, not ſo reall or weighty, (becauſe it concerned the defeat of others, rather then his owne) yet was wondrous tetchy, even at the converſion of Ninivee (thinking it to threaten Iſrael,) yea he was ſicke of vexation, and deſperate in his defeat; and all, becauſe he might not propheſie to the deſtruction of the City, rather then the converſion: How much more when the ſpirituall defeat concernes the ſoule it ſelfe neerly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it muſt needs be, that whereſoever the ſuppoſed attaining of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>5</label> that which an unſound heart coveteth, would breed a great, yea too great and exceſſive rotten joy and content; there the defeat of the ſame thing muſt breed an exceeding diſcontent. But the hypocrite when hee thinkes that his hope is ſatisfied, and hath his deſire, (for he deceives himſelfe) is exceedingly joyed;<note place="margin">Jonah 4.</note> needs therefore muſt he be diſquieted when he is defeated. See it in an illuſion, <hi>Ionahs</hi> gourd cauſed an idle yet extreame content, more then ſuch a bable ſhould; therefore when the Lord ſmote it, he was moſt baſely diſtempered. The ſuddener the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up of the ſeed was in the gravelly ground, the ſuddener was the withering of it. A little to inſiſt upon this: There is no feaſt with ſtollen bread and waters, ſo ſweet as the feaſt of hypocrites, who live upon ſtealth from God: To ſeeme to have gotten a felicity by our owne wit and induſtry, without ſelfe-deniall, is more then to joy in treaſures of gold and ſilver; becauſe it reſembles a principle that ſtill affords it from a fountaine: And indeed, if an inferiour could match the opperations of a ſuperiour, if nature I mean, could walke in the furniture of grace, it were great wonderment. Unuſuall attainments, breed impotent ioyes, as when a child of twelve or thirteene, reaches the learning of an elder of nineteene or twenty, when a woman gets arts and tongues, it breeds a very ſickneſſe. How much more here? For a Phariſee to carry away heaven as ſheere, as a beleeving Saint, I wonder not, if it puffe up with exceſſive boaſt and triumph (as baſe as it is) for they ſeeme (with <hi>Iacob</hi> to have overcome God! when then the Lord ſhall take ſuch in hand, convincing, diſappointing and confounding their conſciences, turning
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:45715:154"/> them out of all as beggars and banquerupts (as he will doe all whom hee will ſave, and ſome whom he will not) Oh! we may well conceive what wrath and rage it worketh.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>6</label> Laſtly, we know wrath is a ſhort madneſſe: now mad men put no difference betweene any. If a King ſhould come in a mad mans way, he would ſtrike him as ſoone as a beggar. So doth Selfe defeated: She puts no difference between God and men: She will ſometime chuſe men to whet herſelf on, ſometime God himſelf: She curſeth her luck and bad fortune, the weather if too wet, too dry, too hot or too cold, her ill lot and ſucceſſe, her ill market, her enemies, any thing that comes in her way: what wonder then if ſhe ſpare not Gods Miniſter, yea God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? She luſteth after envy, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, and out of an ill cuſtome and habit, growes to be as old with God as with men, if hee croſſe her, ſhe knowes not, ſhe is not capable of ſubjection.

God doe ſo to me and more, if I reſtore not this day, the Kingdome to <hi>David!</hi> He could not beare it: So <hi>Ioab</hi> (juſt like him) having cut off <hi>Abſolon</hi> in a dangerous warre,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 19.7.</note> and reſtored <hi>David: David</hi> (unſeaſonably) falls a mourning! what doth <hi>Ioab?</hi> So rageth that he comes and dares <hi>David</hi> thus to his face, Now I ſee if <hi>Abſolon</hi> had beene alive, though we had all dyed, thou wouldeſt have liked it well? But I ſweare by the Lord, if thou come not forth and ſhew thy ſelfe, all thy people ſhall goe away from thee; it is enough to name theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: Let us all abhorre this bitter curſed roote of ſelfe-defeated rage, and as we would loath it in matter of Religion, ſo let it be odious to us even towards men; accuſtoming our ſelves to be content, though wee heare ill when we have done well, which is a royall grace indeed.</p>

               <p>To whom I anſwer, The Lord rebuke all ſuch wretches! God open their eies! For tell me I pray you, theſe waiters upon God, how live they the whiles? Moſt looſely, deny themſelves no liberty, luſt or will of their owne, but laſh it on upon the ſcore, till grace come and wipe off all; they ſpare for no ſinne committing, to be lewd companions, drinkers, covetous or the like: For why ſhould they? If heaven will be favourable, it can pardon great, as well as ſmall offences: If it will not, in vaine ſhould they ſtrive! For they have no ſtrength of their owne (they confeſſe) to reſtraine from any ſuch courſes till God turne their hearts; &amp; then you ſhall ſee what manner of perſons they will be, when they be of Gods making, you ſhall ſee what new men they ſhall be: But oh you white Divells! you that turne rebellion into ſmoothneſſe, and play the ſtill ſwine who eate up all the draffe, how ſhould ſuch as you ever come into Gods mint to be new ſtamped? I denounce unto you, that all your hypocriſie tends to the vailing over of your ſinne; it is not grace you ſeeke, if your breſts were open, hell and deſtruction are there, and the way of peace you have not knowne: Peace you would have, pardon and heaven, Gods love and favour, but your curſed wills you would not forgoe: And therefore that ye would have, (mercy I meane) you ſhall never have, and what ye would ſhunne, you ſhall for ever inherit, even woe and wrath.</p>
               <p>I know ſome of this ſort are not ſo prophane as others; but feed themſelves with duties and moralities, a ſmooth way of Religion, and ſo wait:<note place="margin">Matth. 3. Eſay 30.</note> But who hath taught ſuch to eſcape the wrath to come, by their ſloth and eaſe? What although it be our ſtrength to ſit ſtill? Muſt we therefore ſuſpend our labour, paines and uſe of meanes? Will God be found in a way of eaſe, of yawning deſires, and lazy hopes, which ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre to be guided Gods way, and to come to his oath and covenant of humiliation, aith and ſelfe-deniall? No neither the prophane, nor the lazy, ſhall enter into his reſt, no more then the rebellious: They main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a ſecret diſtemper and pritch of heart, and tetch of ſelfe againſt God, and either will be ſaved their owne way, or not at all: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to theſe I alſo profeſſe (with ſharpe reproofe) The way to peace yee have not knowne, neither will; you rather will quarrell with God for not fulfilling you wills, to make you ſuch as you would bee, without your trouble: This way God never knew: Nay, I ſay more, Though God would ſave you, yet you would not, if ye might; and I may ſay
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:45715:156"/> truly, ſalvation it ſelfe cannot ſave ſuch as would not, becauſe it ſaves none but the willing. Pull downe your curſed ſpirits, and ceaſe to kicke againſt the pricks, for till you be content to abandon your luſts and eaſe, you doe ſecretly cavill with him, whom you ſhall never be able to make your cauſe good againſt; you ſtand not right in your plea, the Court is Gods, &amp; the judgement is his, who ſhall curſe all weapons formed againſt himſelfe, and condemne all thoſe moſt juſtly who cavill againſt him. Therefore I ſay againe, take this word of reproofe with meekeneſſe,<note place="margin">Eſay 54. ult.</note> and ſit ſtill in the point of cavilling, but abhorre to goe againſt Gods edge by your prophanenſſe, or your eaſe; for the Lord will never beleeve, that either of theſe will ever be content to finde mercy, though they might enjoy it: And as <hi>Eſau</hi> when time came would have had the bleſſing, but yet would be ſtill a ſenſuall Epicure, and therefore it was finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed him: So I ſay to you, If in truth you would have grace, pray to God to plucke up that roote of bitterneſſe which ſprings up in you;<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> for that will defile you faſter then all your idle and falſe wiſhes can clenſe you, and no wonder if you well weigh it!</p>

Is this equity, that the Lord ſhould alike eſteeme of the painfull and the lazy? I anſwer thee, yea if Selfe defeated be the caviller: Thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt paines it ſeemes, that thou mighteſt be warme by thine owne ſparkles, and have ſomewhat to alledge why God ſhould regard thee!

But oh man! Who art thou that diſputeſt with God? Shall the axe quarrell with him that cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with it? I anſwer thee therefore, The Lord doth not ſimply equall thee with ſuch as take no paines, keepe thy paines ſtill, and if thou wilt, adde more unto them, but rather take away thy upbraiding ſpirit; doe that thou doſt with meekneſſe, and be content to ſinke in thy coſtes, and be as nothing, an unprofitable one when thou haſt done all, caſt not God in teeth with them, call not for them backe againe, nor bring him his owne in a napking: For theſe qualities poyſon all thy labours,<note place="margin">Gods hearers will be at Gods diſpoſe for bleſſing.</note> and drive the Lord further off, rather then draw him nearer: And when thou haſt turned all thy ſelfe-defeated diſcontent into ſelfe-deniall, and art willing that the Lord ſhould doe with thee as he liſt, then ſee how he will diſpoſe of thee: A little barley or an handfull of meale with a little oile ſhall make a more accepted meat offering to him (with an heart willing to be at his diſpoſe) then all thy plenty of coſtly ſacrifices with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it!<note place="margin">Joel. 2.13.</note>

The point will better ariſe when we have opened it,<note place="margin">Opening of the point.</note> as the text affords it: For hitherto, (&amp; eſpecially in the two verſes before) we have ſeen <hi>Naaman</hi> very unhappy in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: Firſt, in his wrong aſſaying of the King of Iſrael: Secondly, in his bootleſſe attendance at the doore of <hi>Eliſha:</hi> Thirdly, In his rejecting the meſſage, wherein both the way and the ſucceſſe of his cure was tendred unto him. In ſpeciall we have ſeene the prejudice of his owne heart pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting all taſte and liking of the meſſage: Then we have ſeene his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſhifts wherein he hath taken pleaſure, for the confirming of himſelfe in his error: Laſtly, we have ſeene him fall to play the foole and mad man, wallowing in his bloud, and foaming out his owne ſhame, in pride and rage. All which laid together, preſent unto us a man wholly wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to himſelfe, and foole-hardy to get out of thoſe armes of mercy which had offered themſelves to him for better ends then he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; fighting and ſtruggling againſt that good which yet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe pretended to ſeeke: And now who is there (that lookes with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a mans eie) beholding <hi>Naaman</hi> in this pickle and miſery, but would be ready to paſſe ſentence upon him and give him as gone? who is there, that ſeeing one deadly ſicke, tumbling in his bed without eaſe, and throwing the potion in the Phyſitians face, or againſt the walles, would not ſay, this man is but a dead man, he is paſt cure? Even ſo is it here with <hi>Naaman:</hi> If God were as man, or as willing to turne away in a rage from man, as man is from God, how ſhould he chuſe but periſh? But here is the wonder: <hi>Naamans</hi> cavilling againſt mercy, provokes mercy to ſo much the more pitty; his winding and wreſtling with Gods armes to get out, drawes theſe armes cloſer together to encloſe him in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">If God were as man then were man forlorne.</note>And now between cup and lip, in this narrow necke of deſpaire, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy comes in, and diſputes for him who diſputed againſt it ſelfe, ſaying, poore wretch! whither wouldeſt thou goe from this mercy offered thee? I ſee better then thou, that to yeeld to thy will were to leave thee to ſorrow: but when all is done, mercy muſt heale thee, and therefore call thy ſelfe to better conſideration: Let all thy rebellions become as ſo many ſhamings and tamings of thee for thy folly, humble thy ſelfe ſo much the more deeply, by how much the more thou haſt diſguiſed thy ſelfe, and let thy ſinne be thy ſorrow! Lo here, I reach out cords unto thee of perſwaſion made of many twiſts, the counſell of thy ſervants
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:45715:159"/> about thee, whom I have made wiſer then thy ſelfe, that thou mighteſt come a little lower in thine own ſight, and at laſt become a fool that thou mighteſt be wiſe: And to conclude, I have put ſtrength into their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and perſwaſion into their arguments, and authority into their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Lay hold therefore of this my ſtrength, make peace, and recover health and cure of ſoule and body, from the diſeaſe of the one, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the other, and goe to Jorden, waſh and be cleane: This mercifull aſſiſtance the Lord through this verſe holds forth to <hi>Naaman:</hi> And what comes all this unto? Surely to this iſſue, That looke whom the Lord hath once caſt love upon, according to his good pleaſure, and the purpoſe of calling home; the ſame Lord will ſo faſten upon and hold cloſe to himſelfe, (whatſoever outward diſcouragements, inward oppoſitions and reſiſtances come in the way to hinder it) till by the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible might of his power, he have brought them on ſhore, paſt all danger.</p>
               <p>Let the firſt point then be this, whom God hath begunne with in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting <label type="milestone">

Let us ſee ſome texts and ſome reaſons of it, and ſo come to the uſe. Firſt for reaſons, in a word, the maine is, that God knoweth who are his by their names: And hee will not loſe his owne worke; he will adde to that which he hath done, rather then undoe it by detracting from it: All his workes are perfect, hee leaves nothing by halfes, that were to diſhonour himſelf: Goe no further then <hi>Naamans</hi> example here, God had already prevented him, and brought him fairely towards both cure and converſion: Now if he had left him in the briars of his owne difficulties, and ſuffered the prevention to come to nothing, what a croſſing ſhould this have beene to his ends? He who prevents that he might aſſiſt, will not faile of his purpoſe. <hi>Moſes</hi> tells the Lord,<note place="margin">Deut. 9.28.</note> that if he ceaſed now to goe with his people, the heathens would blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme his name, and ſay, It was becauſe he could not bring him through the vaſt wilderneſſe, and ſo the glory of his prevention had been loſt: God then having foreknowledge, power, wiſdome and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe enough to ſerve his own glorious ends, how abſurd were it to think, that any thing could croſſe them, either from without or from within? no enemy, no danger, ſhall hinder the aſſiſtance of grace from that ſoule which hath beene prevented once thereby: Other reaſons will appeare in the anſwer of a queſtion by and by.</p>
               <p>Briefly then for Scriptures. Compare firſt, Exod. 5.21. with 6.1.<note place="margin">Proofes of the Doctrine. Exod. 5.21. and 12.31.</note> The Lord meant the deliverance of Iſrael both outward and ſpirituall, by the hand of <hi>Moſes:</hi> He had already and long prevented them by the glad tidings thereof, and the expectation of it: But ſo it fell out, that in the attempt thereof, matters went very croſſe and awry, as appeares by the text, for notwithſtanding the oft aſſayes of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> yet he held them off with delayes; and the plagues being ſtaid, the bondage continued, his heart hardned more, and he would not let them goe: Nay more, thoſe very inſtruments in whom (next to God) their confidence was, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> rather occaſioned their greater miſery, inſomuch that that the people thought it had beene better if the onſet had never beene made: Now when they ſaw this, the Elders come to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:45715:160"/> God be judge betweene us and you (<hi>q.d.</hi> we pray God there be plaine dealing among you) for you have made us ſtinke in the ſight of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> all goes worſe and worſe through your mediation:<note place="margin">Exod. 5.20.21.</note> who would have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked this contrariety? Yet the Lord (who could exalt himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all theſe lets, and over <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelfe) wrought to his people a deliverance even from hence; and that which this tyrant would not permit willingly to be done, lo, the Lord by forcible breaking in upon him, doth compell him to, and in the way of ſaving Iſrael from him, overthrowes himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 9.5.35.36.</note>See Joh. 9. When the Lord Jeſus had once prevented that poore blinde creature with love, and the handſell of his cure, preſently (in ſtead of good ſucceſſe) all falls out very foule; for why? The Phariſees (to ſtoppe the glory of it) ſwarme like hornets about this poore man, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting him with queſtions, and ſnaring him with their malice, till at laſt, for his loyall Apology for Chriſt, they had caſt him out by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.

Yet that could not keepe off Gods preventing mercy from caſting him downe and taming him; and being ſo caſt downe, and a breach made, let the Lord ſlacken his worke? Did he not aſſiſt it ſtrongly? When this poore priſoner (inſtead of purſuant) lay blinde and deſolate, yea when all were affraid to meddle with him (as thinking the Lion to be couchant for a skill, that he might be rampant after) how doth the Lord breake through all difficulties, and ſends <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> to open the eies both of his body and ſoule, and make him a ſound man! And thus here this poore <hi>Naaman</hi> (in ſhew) further from cure then at firſt; how doth the Lord ſtrangely turne the winde out of the Eaſt of a diſtemper, into the South of a calme?

I ſay, his aſſiſtance is alway according to the ſoules difficulty: Here in this caſe of <hi>Naaman</hi> we may clearly ſee how he ſteppes in by the ſervants, furniſhing them with more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of his caſe, and inabling them to ponder the ſame with the ſad effects of it, more then <hi>Naaman</hi> himſelfe, and hereby kindling in them a ſparkle of divine counſell, which enabled them to ſpeake wiſely, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, pertinently, and in due ſeaſon according to his condition, with ſpeciall bleſſing ſucceeding the ſame, and carrying it home to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſpirit: how eaſily had the thing fallen out otherwiſe in every of theſe, had not God aſſiſted him? By theſe inſtruments, the Lord firſt ſtopped the precipitate minde of <hi>Naaman,</hi> from ſo ſuddaine a departure; weakened his ſtrong conceit, overthrew his carnall cavill, abated his pride, cooled his rage, enlarged the promiſe, the eaſineſſe, the probable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yea the divineneſſe and certainty thereof, till having beaten downe his high thoughts, he is made a low valley, and prepared for cure and converſion. So in like manner doth the Lord worke in any ſoule which needs his ſeconding aſſiſtance towards the enjoying of ſalvation: he will not ſuffer them to want any helpe which may further them. For example,<note place="margin">Inſtances.</note> Doth the Lord ſee their diſcouragements to come from others?

Hee walked under the banner of his fathers protection: Even ſo it hath pleaſed thee O Lord! to fence and fortifie my poore ſoule, that neither my deſertions, when I thought my ſelfe caſt off, and in deſpaire, (through unbeleefe) nor the dint of my afflictions, (when as yet the arrowes of God dipt in venome, ſtucke in me,) nor the malice of enemies, nor the fiery darts of Satan piercing me by my luſts, could ever wholly divorce me from thee: Oh! how many thouſands have fallen on my right hand, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny on my left, ſince I beganne? Men of like age, birth and education, of better parts and endowments then I; and yet, mercy hath kept mee hitherto: nay <hi>Naaman</hi> was never ſo ſullen and froward with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and with Jorden, as I have beene wayward with God, ſometime weary of his croſſes, cavilling againſt his governement, both in generall and ſpeciall, ready to leave his worke, to renounce his Sabbaths, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, Promiſes and all, becauſe I could not ſee how God performed them to me! when I have beene oppreſſed with Selfe, and a dead, ſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and ſavourleſſe heart, ready to give the Lord and his trade quite
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:45715:162"/> over; yet he hath revived me, and not ſuffered me to revolt quite from him by all theſe; ſtill by the power of poore faith he hath kept mee to ſalvation, he hath delivered, doth and will deliver me ſtill, if I can waite. Oh! wonder at this grace of his, and let the firſt linke of vocation, be a warrant to thee, that the linke of juſtification, ſanctification and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall never be broken, but he that brought thee through ſo many unlikelyhoods, to beleeve; can and will (now much more) bring thee through as great oppoſitions to perſevere: enjoy thy priviledge, ſtand at gaze, and boaſt onely of the Lord. Thus much for the uſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let this doctrine be an incouragement to all feeble and fearfull <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> ſoules, who think they ſhall never wade out of their diſtruſt,<note place="margin">Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all feeble and fearfull ones.</note> ignorance of Gods way, their deepe pride, Selfe, rebellion and hypocriſie; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold theſe corruptions (by which Satan holds poſſeſſion as by Forts and Bulwarks) as evident markes of their periſhing one day, and that they are ſo ſtrong, that they will maſter grace, and deprive them finally of hope. But poore ſoule! ſtay a while, doe not ſo hardly ſentence thy ſoule: Looke here upon a poore Pagan out of covenant, an alien from God, behold how freely God prevented him at firſt, when he ſought him not; how graciouſly he aſſiſted him, and that when he was paſt all ſenſe of it, deepe in the ſence of the contrary: One (I ſay) that had no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, meerly an hangby to the viſible Church, (ſave that he was ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an inviſible bounty of unſpeakeable goodneſſe) and yet lo, when he was at the ſaddeſt point, and the loweſt ebbe of diſpaire, ſuddenly (as if this were Gods ſeaſon to breake his heart, and to win him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, all hope of good ſucceſſe being paſt) there appeares a change of his wretched condition, into an happy; ſecret mercy had firſt marked him out for God, and the ſame ſtill waited on him not ſuffering him to ſlippe away, and depart from welfare. Hath God done this in the green tree, and ſhall not he doe it in the dry? Haſt thou (O poore ſoule) either deeper diſtempers then <hi>Naaman</hi> had, or ſadder affronts then he, within or without? Canſt not thou take courage to thy ſelfe by a promiſe, when hee found mercy without one? What is it then that cauſeth thee to be ſo heavy? In the following points, I ſhall ſpeake further to thee, onely here let me ſay this, If thou canſt prove that God hath once ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly prevented thee (whereof upon the ninth verſe I have at large ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) I can prove hee will not forſake thee, he will not loſe any one ſtroke of worke upon thee, but will aſſiſt it, and in time perfect it: Sure I am, thou canſt not feel thy ſpirit deader or further off then did <hi>Naaman,</hi> thou canſt not be further out of Gods precinct then he was; and yet the Lord beyond hope, turned all to as happy an iſſue, as the premiſes ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable.</p>
               <p>Take thou like courage unto thy ſelfe. All thy unkindly affronts ſhall end well: when thou art weary of hearing, God ſhall revive thy ſpirit, ſo that thou ſhalt heare a voice behinde thee, ſaying, heare ſtill, thou ſhalt not be able for thy heart to give over the ordinances; thy ſullen heart ſhall not be permitted to prevaile in thee againſt the promiſe; do what thou canſt, ſome light or other ſhall appear to encourage thee, to caſt out thy prejudice, cavills, frowardnes, when others are left to themſelves to ſinke
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:45715:163"/> in their owne peeviſh rebellions thou ſhalt finde pitty; thy tender nurſe ſhall uſe all his wiſdome not againſt thee, but for thee, and ſhall not bee provoked to give thee over, as thou doſt him; thou ſhalt ſee it and bleſſe thoſe armes that comprehended thee, when thou couldeſt not containe thy ſelfe; thoſe feet that followed thee, thoſe hands that laid hold on thee, ſaying, returne O Shulamite, returne! whither wilt thou goe? Out of bleſſing into the warme Sunne? What boot will that bee to thee? What an occaſion of endleſſe repentance and regret will it bee to thee hereafter, to leave God in a tetch, to forſake cleare, evident, ſure mercies, upon a toy and conceit of thine owne, againſt the promiſe of him that cannot lye? Oh! conſider better of it, lay not the bottome of remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe woe betimes! Thou ſhalt wiſh one day of the Sonne of man here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and that it were with thee, as it hath beene, but then, the guilt of thy former contempt and fullenneſſe ſhall be a thouſand witneſſes againſt thee! Thus the Lord ſhall even revive the ſpirit of <hi>Naamans</hi> ſervants, in thy ſpirit, to pull thee backe from the pit, and prepare thee for mercy.</p>
               <p>Onely beware thou yeeld not to thy temptations, but waite upon the word:<note place="margin">A caution hereupon.</note> Suffer not this grace of God in thee to be ſlighted, (as it is by hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites) or to be damped and eclipſed by wantonneſſe, wordlineſſe and baſe luſts (as it is by prophane wretches, for theſe will rankle in thee, and fret into thy bowels a as canker) and then feare not but other annoyances ſhall ceaſe in due time, and turne to a ſweet calme in thee, when ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord Jeſus awaking out of his ſleepe ſhall rebuke them, as he did the ſtorme and waves which threatned the ſhip wherein he lay; for it is as poſſible that thoſe ſhould have overwhelmed him and his Diſciples, as theſe ſhall ovewhelme thee: perhaps thou conflicteſt with boylings of corruptions, and rebellings againſt the Law of faith and righteouſneſſe of the Lord Jeſus; but even theſe ſhall humble thee, &amp; turn to great caſting of Self out of thee: perhaps thou art caſt upon ſame unwelcome croſſes, loſſes, ſickneſſe, feare of death (before thy peace be made:) be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, the Lord doth not try thee in vaine, they are to make ſure worke of thy heart, and to bring thee to a duer ſight of thy ſelfe, they are not to deſtroy thee, although thou maieſt thinke them ſent to diſcourage thee, God ſhall put more courage then ſo into thee, hee hath the power of death in his hand, and it ſhall not ſeize upon thee, till the worke of God in thee be paſt danger: The bed of thy ſorrow, and the racke of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the clattering of thy bones, and thy loathing of dainty meates, and drawing neare to the grave, ſhall not hurt thee; for all ſhall end well,<note place="margin">Job 33.</note> and turne thee from the pit; and when thou art convinced thereof, thy loathneſſe ſhall be turned to readineſſe; as <hi>Peters</hi> was, Joh. 13.9. and thou ſhalt ſay, Doe what thou wilt Lord, if for good, I am ready to ſtoope: perhaps thy owne parents, wife in boſome, beſt friends and companions turne enemies, looke eſtrangedly, lye at thee with threats, taunts, ſcornes, for thy caſting them off, and looking ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way: But be quiet, the Lord ſhall teach thy fingers to fight, and thee to thinke that the more pretious, for which the Divell ſo bluſters againſt thee; reſolve to beare what thou canſt, but ſurrender not thy hopes: perhaps when the Law hath laid thee open to the ſight of thine owne

In a word, Satan will diſquiet thee with Atheiſticall thoughts againſt God, Providence, Scriptures, the threats, the promiſes, as if they were all but fables, (ſo the wicked world through error counts them) but in all this confuſion the Lord ſhall not leave thee, (and as I ſaid before) through this ſea (dried up,) he ſhall bring his ſcattered ones, rather then they ſhall periſh. All ſhall give place (be it never ſo oppoſite) rather then Gods worke ſhall be defeated. And ſo much for this point of coherence may ſerve.</p>
               <p>Another thing there is to be noted here,<note place="margin">Ground of ſecond point. Gods conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing ſtill to buffet and humble <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
                  </note> ere I come to the ſubſtance of the words: And that is, that this thirteenth verſe wholly aimes at a third buffeting and ſubduing of <hi>Naamans</hi> ſpirit to the obedience of Gods command: Twice already you have heard how the Lord croſſed him: once by the idle carriage of the King who rent his cloathes, when hee thought he would have healed him: Another time, when he waited at <hi>Eliſha's</hi> doore, for an anſwer of reall cure, without delay: We ſee theſe did but incenſe the froward ſpirit of <hi>Naaman,</hi> and ſet him on carping and cavilling; and not onely ſo, but upon a will and ſtomacke of his owne to turne away and give over all: Therefore to take downe his high lookes, and that the cure which now followed, might not light upon ſo rebellious a peece: Lo, the Lord tames him this third time, not by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Eliſha</hi> to ſhame him, but by ſetting him to ſchoole to his poore ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and underlings; ſuch as commonly were glad to be at his becke, Doe this and he doth it, goe and he goeth, come and he commeth. But lo, now the caſe is altered, the Lord ſo honours them, that rather hee is under their authority, they bid him come backe, and he commeth, they exhort him to goe to Jorden and he goeth, they bid him doe this, Waſh ſeven times, and he doth it, yea and he is a happier man by thus obeying then ever in all his dayes by commanding. We know, when a Parent will abaſe a proud ſonne, he will not vouchſafe to correct him himſelfe, but put him to his Oſtler or to his Groome to be chaſtened, and this takes downe the pride of his ſonne: So here: The Lord keepes <hi>Eliſha</hi> within doores, and ſets the ſervants of this great ſtout Champion, to take him to taske, ſo ordering it that they muſt be conquerors of him, who yet had got ſo many victories: Now they can charme and levell his ſpirit, more then any other, and now theſe poore fellowes of farre leſſe wit, policy and inſight, muſt yet be inſpired with more of Gods meaning then himſelfe, muſt be appointed as his teacher, to doe him better ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in this their ſuperiority, then ever they did before.</p>
               <p>And it ſeemes to me,<note place="margin">Opening of the ground further.</note> that in theſe two reſpects the Lord would tame his ſpirits by his ſervants: the one this, That now he ſees them convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of that myſtery of truth which lay hidden in the Prophets meſſage, and appeared not to himſelfe, he thinkes it high time to follow: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond this, That now his ſtomacke is left without any abettors, his high ſpirit is left to it ſelfe, from the Prophet he had that he could have, and ſo, now his ſervants turne abettors of the Prophet againſt him, turne
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:45715:164"/> ſtrong Counſellors againſt his rage and carnall diſtempers: not one now of all his retinue that ſticks to him, or humor him; now he is in a ſtrait, in a ſtrange place, he is like to goe home uncured alone, if he will needs goe, for not the pooreſt page of his company dare carry him home a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, all offer their beſt ſervice to Jorden for a cure, all are for God, and for the end of providence, ſway'd as one man to the obedience of the charge, not one offers his attendance to Aram: The ſpeech is, woe to him that is alone;<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8.</note> but here it is contrary, happy is he who is left alone; miſerable while he was abetted, happy being forſaken: For why? Now there is no remedy but Jorden, all cry that way; now hee is in a ſtrait, now ſervants and all are for it, what ſhould he thinke but the finger of God is in it to perſwade? hee can but venture to try, there he may have helpe, at home there is none, what then ſhould he now do but try? Oh! what a turning of the ſtreame beginnes here to be? What a venture is now made upon this ſo long cavilled and ſcorned Jorden? And with the entring of theſe thoughts, lo, more and more light entreth, ſo that at laſt he obeyeth. Out of both theſe paſſages (brethren) let me note ſomewhat, and that but briefly; and I will no longer hold you from the ſubſtance of the words themſelves.</p>

               <p>Firſt, (as you know) I beganne with the attemptors,<note place="margin">The firſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall head of the verſe, the attemptors.</note> theſe ſervants of <hi>Naaman;</hi> in whom I conſidered, Firſt, that ſpeciall duty of loyall faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to their Maſters ſoule and body, and the welfare of both: This I call the duty they ſtood bound unto by vertue of their relation. Sutable whereto was his commendation in a due reſpect and tenderneſſe towards them, as a father towards children. Father (ſay they) if the Prophet, &amp;c. The word I grant, is generally a tearme of reverence; howbeit here, the realneſſe of their faithfulneſſe, ſhews that there was more in it. They car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a filiall ſubjection towards him, as to a father of peculiar honor &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:45715:167"/> with them: No children could have more faithfully demeaned themſelves to their naturall Parent, then theſe ſervants did to <hi>Naaman.</hi> For why?<note place="margin">Opening of this ground of the ſervants fidelity.</note> they obſerving the ſcope of their Maſters journey to bee weighty; an object of great expectation to their Maſter; and ſeeing him now through his diſtemper, to take a courſe contrary to his owne deſignes, yea thereby being ready to renounce the meanes of his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare by a meere tetch, and pritch againſt the Prophet. What doe they? Moſt faithfully ſet themſelves to procure a redreſſe of this error, as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing it like to be ſad and remedileſſe, except prevented in time. And this they do with ſome earneſtneſſe, (ſeeing the caſe ſo to require) that is, they oppoſe him in his mood and humors, ſeeke to rectifie them, and breed a good opinion of the Prophet in him, that ſo he might obey the meſſage, recover the cure, and turne from his wilfull purpoſe of a wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full departure. This will better appeare, if we conceive that which ſome ſervants, yea the moſt, would have done in this caſe. Surely to demerit their Maſter, &amp; to humour him in his baſe pangs, they would have come to him and ſaid, Here is a ſurly fellow indeed, a Prophet who ſent for our Maſter, and yet that ſcornes to ſpeake to him; lo, he hath ſent him a flim, flam, a tale of a tubbe: And what Nobleman of worth could brooke it? Come Maſter, let us ſcorne to attend upon him any longer, let us ſet ſpurres to our horſes and let him goe, let him keepe his cure to himſelfe. If they had ſaid ſo, they might ſurely have beene welcommer to a man of paſſion, then ſpeaking as they did. But the Lord (whoſe the work was) put more faithfull and wiſe thoughts into them then ſo, for the attaining of his ends.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Servants muſt be faithfull to their Maſters, both for body and ſoule.</note> The point then is this, Servants muſt be loyall and faithfull to their Maſters, and procure their good both ſpirituall and outward, for conſcience ſake. I am now entring upon a point of morall nature, yet of ſpeciall uſe and importance, for the inſtruction of this condition of people; which ſeeing I am fallen upon (though beſides my ſcope of this text) yet I will labour to open unto you, as God ſhall give me grace; ere I come to thoſe other points more ſuting to my purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Marke it then: The dutie of ſervants in ſpeciall is, faithfulneſſe to their governours of both ſexes, to whom they belong. Every ſervant ſhould count himſelf as an <hi>Oneſimus</hi> in name and deed to his <hi>Philemon,</hi>

That which once the Duke of Medina, generall to the King of Spaines his fleet againſt England in eighty eight, ſpake baſely, each ſervant ſhould ſpeake out of conſcience. For being asked by one what his meaning was to do with the Engliſh, in caſe he got the day, whether he would not ſpare the Catholicke party; he anſwered, he would neither ſpare one nor other, but make way for his Maſter: A ſpeech of a very wickedly faithfull ſervant: But a good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant muſt ſay ſo: I am for my Maſter, &amp; that is my ſcope. So their Maſter fare well, though they have an ill word and have ſmall thanke (yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time by himſelfe, for flatterers for a time finde more favour, then faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ones) yet they muſt ſtill bee faithfull. Reaſons and proofes are theſe.</p>

When <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was tempted to unfaithfulneſſe in a

No. The trade of a ſervant in each kind is a ſtewardſhip; no ſervant is ſo ſilly, but is or may be in caſe to bee truſted with more or leſſe that way: Now it is required of each ſteward that hee be faithfull;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.2.</note> not that all ſervants are equally betruſted; yet none are ſo ill truſted, but if they deſpiſe conſcience, both the life and ſtate of their Maſter (more or leſſe) may lye at their curteſie. As one ſaid of a traitor, who ſo deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his owne life may eaſily be Maſter of anothers. They are ſuppoſed faithfull, not ſuſpected: If they be falſe what may not they attempt? Chaſtity of wife, of daughter, welfare and ſafety of ſonne, wealth and eſtate of Maſter, name, credit, and content of all. And ſhould ſuch an one bee faithleſſe and not faithfull? No verily, except one maine ſinew of ſociety among men ſhould bee cut in ſunder. Some ſervants are (I grant) more intereſſed in their Maſters then others: Merchants Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Agents, Gentlemens ſtewards, and Auditors, Accomptants, ſome Prentices in the ſhoppe, have the truſt of their Maſters counting bookes, revenewes, receits, monies, and the greater the truſt, the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous the unfaithfulneſſe: (As he who to provide for himſelfe,<note place="margin">Luke 16.6.</note> bids a debtor to his Maſter of an hundred pound, to ſet downe fifty, a ſpeedy way to undoe his Maſter.) But yet all ſervants have temptations enough to be unfaithfull: All therefore, as well one as other muſt be faithfull, yea write fidelity upon their fringes and borders, palmes and ſhoulders; as the high Prieſts Miter had [Holineſſe to the Lord.] This is the firſt reaſon, the honour of their condition requires it; God hath diſpoſed ſo, that it cannot be well otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon: Fidelity was required even of ſlaves, ſuch as thoſe <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>2</label> ſervants were to whom <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles directs his exhortations, 1 Tim. 6.1. and elſewhere. Such as knew no God, no Chriſt, meere heathens, bought and ſold as ſheepe in the Market; ſuch as (if they had beene ſlaine outright) could have beene in no worſe condition, then they were in; and therefore one might looke for nothing from, but deſperateneſſe: Now if theſe were ſo urged to faithfulneſſe, what ſhould ours doe, who are ingenuous, free, partakers of the ſame commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity? If they who had no encouragements; how much more we?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Fidelity is the prime vertue of a ſervant; as ſubjection is of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>3</label> a wife, dutifulneſſe in a child, juſtice in a Magiſtrate, bounty in the rich, &amp;c. All other properties in a ſervant, ſerve this one; gentleneſſe, skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, painfulneſſe, diſcretion, cheerfulneſſe, good carriage, ſtinke without faithfulneſſe. A good ſervant is digged out of the rocke of faithfulneſſe. If then this be the Cardinall vertue, how ſhould a ſervant faile of it, but his failing muſt be great?

               <p>Fourthly, (which is all in all) the moſt wiſe God, the authour of all <label type="milestone">

As then, the ſpokes or ſtaves cannot be wanting to the wheele, but of neceſſity the wheele will ſplit, and the motion thereof will be ſtopped: So faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe cannot be wanting to a ſervant, but (of neceſſity) the whole round of ſerviceableneſſe muſt bee interrupted; which muſt needs inferre a marvellous detriment to the family, when ſo maine an inſtrument of the good and welfare thereof, (through whoſe hands ſo much of the affaires thereof muſt paſſe) is diſabled and perverted.

The element of ſervice, the Maſters worke cannot teach it: Servants muſt goe out of Chriſts Schoole: a true ſervant of Chriſt, faithfull to him, out of love for love, for reconciliation, for pardon, for peace, for grace, will be faithfull for his ſake to a Maſter, (be he good, be he bad) why? Becauſe the maine fidelity of heart to God, will firſt bind him to the Lord Jeſus in what charge ſoever he betruſt him: As if the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſay to a Miniſter, I have loved thee, made thee faithfull, and put thee into my ſervice, I now will have thee declare thy faithfulneſſe to me in feeding my ſheepe and lambes.<note place="margin">Joh. 21.</note> A Miniſter will doe it for the love hee beares Chriſt. So a wife for the love ſhee hath found from Chriſt will be ſubject, a child will bee dutifull; ſo a ſervant faithfull. The influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which this love hath in it, carrieth an inſtinct into the ſoule for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſervice: let God appoint the worke, the love of Chriſt ſhall be the compeller to faithfulneſſe, whether negative, not to filch, not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, not to anſwer againe, not to be untruſty: or affirmative, <hi>viz.</hi> to be reverend, chaſte, true, painfull, truſty: I ſay, out of the Schoole of Chriſt this muſt proceed. Hence it was that <hi>Ioſeph,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 39.9.</note> ſollicited to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſteneſſe with his Miſtreſſe, preſently had his hand upon this hilt, How ſhall I doe this and ſinne againſt God? His Maſter was abſent, he might have abuſed him, and he ignorant who hurt him; but <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had another tye, he had conſcience and peace to forfeit, hee had another Maſters worke to looke at, and better wages to loſe, and therefore this peace ruled him, and he durſt not for his ſoule, (if all pleaſure, profit, eaſe and rewards in the world had been offered) have attempted ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe. Learne yee Maſters in whom your greateſt ſtrength with ſervants lies; not in your awe, feares, rewards or puniſhments: all your ſuccours muſt come from a deeper tye, you muſt be beholding for all the faithfulneſſe of ſervants to their God and their conſcience. Tye them there and you have them bound for burſting, elſe a wet eele is as eaſily held by the tail, as ſuch ſervants when they ſee their opportunity. Hence is that triumph of <hi>Paul</hi> about <hi>Oneſimus:</hi> Oh! faith he, I have begotten him in my chaines! and now I ſend him backe to thee,<note place="margin">Philem. 11.</note> no filcher or fugitive, but profitable to mee and thee, one that now may be truſted. This is the firſt main thing; without this, I would wiſh no Maſter to truſt a ſervant further then he ſees him, let his ſhewes be never ſo great.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Grace adds all qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</note> this will produce ſundry other qualifications in a ſervant ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to faithfulneſſe. Grace only puts wiſdome into a ſervant, and gives
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:45715:169"/> him a diſcerning eye, to behold God in each ordinance: he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges a divinity, a finger of providence in the ſeverall relations of the family,<note place="margin">1. Wiſdome to conſider the Lord as the ordainer of all relations.</note> for great and weighty ends. A common ſervant makes waſh way of his ſervice; lookes at his Maſter for his owne ends, lookes at him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, his abilities: But he lookes not ſo farre as to ſee God the ordainer of relations. For if he did, this would infuſe other principles, as awe, feare, humility, &amp;c. For why? It is God who hath ſo ordered it for the good of a Kingdome, Common-wealth, Church; that there ſhould be ſuperiours, inferiours; ſome meane ones to be trained for time to come to beare rule; others ſuperiours, men of ability, worldly employments, trades, dealings, offices, who alſo have need of inferiours, to be their hands and inſtruments to act and manage for them thoſe buſineſſes which they cannot performe themſelves. And not onely ſo, but alſo it is from God, that the one is ſet over the other, to conveigh &amp; infuſe ſuch skill, art, and knowledge of trades and ſervices, as the inferiour hath not, that ſo by tradition, theſe skills and gifts may be delivered from one to another; and from the ſame God it is, that the inferiour and ignorant, ſhould ſubject himſelfe to that end with all dexterity, diligence and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</p>
               <p>When once this is underſtood, that it is God and not man who hath deviſed this courſe, not onely in the greateſt government of Princes or Magiſtrates, (for they have their ſervants and officers, as he ſaid to Chriſt, Matth. 8.5.6. I my ſelfe (though a Maſter of an hundred men) am under the authority of the Lord Preſident) but even of meaner authority of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Tradeſmen, whether publicke or private, ingenuous or manuall, civill or eccleſiaſticall, ſpirituall or bodily; ſtill the ſame God is the wiſe orderer and diſpoſer of all: Oh! this thought yokes and ſubdues the ſoule to a wiſe, holy and ſubject eſteeme of government, and a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it up in the ſpirit, as an inviolable ordinance of God, not to be dallied with or prophaned.<note place="margin">Rom. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.1.2. Prov. 8.15. Matth. 8,</note> As the Apoſtle ſaith, All authority (leſſe or more) is from God: By him Princes rule, and by the ſame Officers obey; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters command, doe, goe, come; ſervants are ſubject and at their beck: Why? Becauſe they diſcerne a Soveraignty in the ordinance, in the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour awing, ruling, ſubduing the ſpirits of inferiours; in the other, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, adoring and reverencing God in man. Hence <hi>David,</hi> It is the Lord which maketh the people ſubject to me. They rebelled often, but the Lord, (not <hi>Davids</hi> armes, nor <hi>Ioabs</hi> ſword) brought them backe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. So that he who diſobeyes a Prince, a Magiſtrate, Miniſter, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, diſobeyeth not man, but God; and ye ought not to obey for terror and puniſhment,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.4.5.</note> but for conſcience. The very brute creature is ſubjected to ſinfull man by this ordinance; and that cauſes the creature to forget his ſtrength, ſwiftneſſe and ſtomacke, and to take bit and bridle, and to be ſubject: elſe who ſhould tame Lions, Beares, Elephants, Horſes, if they knew their ſtrength? Even ſo, this ſenſe of divineneſſe in mans go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, cauſeth the inferiours will to forget it ſelfe, and to be ſubject to God in man. So that now although both Maſter and ſervant be Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, both free men in Chriſt, yet that is no occaſion to fleſh, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw duty, and to turne inferiority to equality, but to acknowledge God in the moſt loving, familiar and curteous governour, and if the Maſter
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:45715:169"/> be lewd and a divell to the ſervant, (who is godly,) yet he beholds in him that ſacred hand of God, who hath bound his ſpirit to awe and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, not to a man for vantage, but to God for conſcience. So much for the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Thirdly this produces a marvellous gift in a ſervant,<note place="margin">3. It produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſubj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> For the firſt, It is not the ſtate of an inferiour, which can exempt a man from pride and diſdaine. None is ſo low but he loves to be Maſter of ſomething. Yee ſhall not ſee three or foure cattell together, but one will be Maſter. There is a wofull pride of ſpirit in man, diſdaining to bee under any. As thoſe baſe Jewes,<note place="margin">Joh. 8.33.</note> (in their greateſt ſlavery) yet vaunted they were free men and never ſerved any. And hence it is, that we call the meere underling the dogge, as of a Schoole, of a family &amp;c. So loathſome a thing is ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But marke, let conſcience of love, and ſenſe of divineneſſe in an ordinance, poſſeſſe the ſpirit of a man, and this ſinkes his ſpirit by and by. As it is ſaid,<note place="margin">1 King 10.5</note> the Queen of Sheba came to <hi>Salomon</hi> with an equall and high ſpirit to diſpute; but ſeeing more then a man in him, lo, her ſpirit fayled her: What is that? She felt an infinite inequality in her ſelfe to <hi>Salomon,</hi> thought it no diſparagement to her ſelfe, to be inferiour to ſo wiſe a man as he: and therefore ſet her heart at reſt from any more bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling thoughts, and calmed herſelfe to a moſt meeke ſelfe-deniall. If meere gifts will doe ſo, what will grace doe? Surely much more. For as it will cauſe the inferiour to ſinke and beat downe his ſpirit under the authority of a well &amp; ably qualified governour, (as I grant God requires all to be) ſo yet it will diſcover a divine power, even in the weake and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified, by vertue whereof, it will deny it ſelfe, and ſay, I quaſh my proud and baſe heart, (which would eaſily diſdaine to ſubmit better parts of wit, skill, Religion, to one that wants all) to God in man, although I ſee nothing in him that ſhould deſerve it.</p>
               <p>And this true ſelfe-deniall is the roote of all faithfulneſſe in a ſervant. For pride and ſtoutneſſe in an inferiour will alway be ſlipping necke out of the collar: Shall ſuch an one as I, of ſuch breed, worth, abilities, ſtoop to obey and ſerve, eſpecially ſuch an unworthy one? No, I ſcorne it! Oh! but this ſcorne marres the ſervant, becauſe it deſtroyes the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance! God muſt levell thy heart, and fill thy valley, and caſt downe thine hill, that thou maieſt ſay, downe ſtout heart, God lookes not at what thou ſeemeſt otherwiſe, but at thy inferiority, and in that reſpect commands thee not to looke at what thy proud heart would, but at what his ordinance hath thought wiſeſt: Better thou loſe thy proud heart, (which ſhall be thy gaine) then God loſe his honour, the ordinance her due regard, and ſo both Kingdome, Church and family, the good which thy ſubjection procures. By this meane the ſtoutneſſe of the heart ſtoops and is convinced, that is but an equall thing it ſhould be ſubject.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, the barre being ſo removed, the heart is let out to the fruits of humbleneſſe; that is, to ſerviceableneſſe. For what ſhould I refuſe to doe, for, or under ſuch a governour, as I ſee by the wiſdome of God ſet over me, for both mine owne, and for a generall good, and the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:45715:170"/> ends of providence? If once I ſee how wofull a confuſion it were to pervert an ordinance; how can I chuſe but alſo deeme it a ſtrange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe for one under the ordinance to withdraw ſervice? What is ſelfe-deniall, but a letting out, and taking downe of a baſe heart, (think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf too good to ſerve) to a willingneſſe in undertaking what ſervice ſoever the rules of honeſt government can impoſe without grudging or contradiction? So that as a proud heart is bound up ſoule and body; ſo an humble ſpirit is enlarged unto every ſuch ſervice, as reaſon guided by Religion, can impoſe. Nothing can come amiſſe to an humble heart; ſelfe-deniall of her owne accord, falls to ſerviceableneſſe. And what wonder? When once the ſpirit of an inferiour hath no drift, will, way of his owne, beſides his Maſters, but is wholly his, and for him: how can it chuſe but utter it, in doing as it is bidden? Goe, come, doe this and he doth it? This for the Third.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, hence comes faith to fall to her worke. For as a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in his generall worke of Religion,<note place="margin">4. Grace in inferiors, ſets faith on work. 1. Purgeth the ſoule of ſpeciall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.</note> ſo a ſervant in his ſpeciall relation of ſervice, lives by faith: And how? In theſe three reſpects. Firſt, faith clenſes out of the ſoule all thoſe diſtempers which uſually poſſeſſe the ſpirit of ſervants. It is not enough for faith to purifie the conſcience in generall from all dead works: But in ſpeciall, it deſcends deeply and ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the corruption which creepes into duties, into the graces of the ſoule, into the uſe of meanes, into the particular relations wherein the ſoule ſtands to God, whether directly or indirectly: Elſe what were a generall purging of evill which comes not into act? But it purgeth each privy corner of the heart, and brings the heart thus purged before God, in the ſeverall occaſions which are offered. Nothing comes between the cup &amp; the lip in this caſe: All particular falſhood will be hunted out of a ſervant, whoſe heart is clenſed by faith from all dead workes; all baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and diſtempers will give place: There is not one baſe quality of the heart, but if nouriſhed, will corrupt faithfulneſſe; if any one ſtring bee out of tune this harmony will vaniſh: any caſe or ſloth of heart will make a man unſaithfull in point of diligence: an angry froward heart will make a man unfaithfull in point of anſwering againe and cavilling: any falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and hollowneſſe will cauſe unfaithfulneſſe in point of doing the ſervice which it promiſes, as he who ſaid, hee would goe into his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters vineyard,<note place="margin">Matth. 21.30.</note> yet went not: In a word, a corrupt heart will be unfaithfull to the marriage bed of his Maſter, defile his children with curſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, filch away his commodities, report wickedly of him as an hard Maſter, who reapes where he ſowed not, corrupt the reſt of the fellow ſervants, and what not? Onely faith clenſes the heart of theſe evills, and juſtles them out of place; for how can Chriſt agree with Belial, or theſe with faithfulneſſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Furniſhes the heart with good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note>Secondly, faith frames the image of God in the ſoule, as in generall, ſo in the particular relations of life; that furniſheth the heart with ſweet qualities, with promote faithfulneſſe: What trouble is to an heart which is diligent, to take any paines? To an heart that loves the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters good, and is upright, to ſeeke the credit, welfare of the Maſter? To an heart that is well grounded, what baſe commands of an ungodly governour will prevaile againſt faithfulneſſe to God? To an heart well
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:45715:170"/> ſeaſoned with grace, for the right manner, due meaſure and the right ends of obeying, what ſervice will be difficult? Now faith it is, which onely can make faithfull.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, faith having thus qualified the heart,<note place="margin">3. It puts it it into actuall exerciſe.</note> doth alſo put it into ſervice, cauſeth this habit of fidelity to appeare in the courſe of ſervice; refuſing no employment whereby the heart may utter it ſelfe for Gods ſake, to man; to whom God hath committed authority and commiſſion to preſſe obedience and faithfulneſſe, in a lawfull condition of life; whereof more in the exhortation (if Cod will) ſhall be ſpoken. I now haſten to the Uſes.</p>

For Terror firſt, Alas! whither ſhall we goe to finde ſuch as firſt give themſelves to God, and after to their Maſters? Who lookes after entrance, or moulding into Gods principles? They doubt not, but to the worke they are hired unto, they can diſpatch it, (ſo can horſes and oxen) and goe through ſtitch with it! They have been in good houſes they ſay, where there were folke as hard to pleaſe as others, and yet them they could give content too, and they hope they are wiſe enough to make their covenants: But as for being made faithfull, (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 Tim. 1.) and putting into Gods ſervice firſt, alas! they know not what it meanes! ſo they be faithfull droiles and drudges, they thinke more cannot be required, ſo they can doe worke enough, what care they to lye, to ſweare, to guzzle, (at their times appointed) to abuſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the Sabbaths, to balke the congregation, to runne about their own occaſions, when God ſhould be worſhipped? And if they be reproved, they aske, Is not your worke done? And ſo thinke to ſtoppe all mouthes: But alas! There be yet worſe then theſe! even debaucht and ſlacke hayred companions, whoſe trade and courſe of life it is, to runne from Maſter to Maſter, and when they have wearied one houſe, then runne to another and poyſon that, with their prophane, drunken, uncleane, and curſed qualities? I ſpeake of this Nation of bad ſervingmen, then which generally none are more ignorant of God, or looſe licentious in life: As for faithfulneſſe to their Maſters, they know none, ſave to caſt on their livery, and waite upon them idely at home or abroad, and ſpend their dayes and yeares in a moſt vaniſhing curſed prophaneneſſe. And the truth is, the condition of ſervants in the houſes of great men, (who keepe a retinue and attendance of ſervants for ſtate and number) is ſo idle, and ſlothfull, (for the moſt part) that it is of neceſſity, that ſervants be ſo wicked, eaſe and baſe ſloth ſo defiling them, that whether they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part quickly, they peſter ſo many the more houſes, or if they abide, they defile that houſe ſo deeply, that the taint of it can never bee waſhed out.</p>

God they ſee none in an ordinance; their governours they looke at as they ſerve their turne, as they ſhew them countenance, according to the vayles they can get under them: But as for conſcience to deny their proud hearts, to live meekely, ſubjectly and patiently under that yoke which God hath put them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they are ſo farre from it, that let them be croſſed, their blood being up, they neither will ſpare their Maſters in words, nor deeds, blowes nor wounds! What wonder? They never came where Religion and faith grew, their ſent is ſtill in them, and occaſion being offered, there is no baſeneſſe ſo horrible, but they will commit it, no unfaithfulneſſe ſo great, but they will adventure it?

How many unfaithfull ſervants to the ſoules of their Maſters, as <hi>Doeg</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> alway ſuggeſting falſe accuſations againſt them who are moſt faithfull to them, that ſo they may betray them? How many who are Bauds &amp; Pandars to their Maſters, to helpe them in their curſed pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to procure the harlots, and keepe their counſells, to draw them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to endleſſe expences, luſts, quarrells with their Chriſtian yokefellowes, lewd and clandeſtine companies, waſting of their ſtates and patrimonies? How many that ſerve their turnes, (as <hi>Sauls</hi> ſervants did his, in bringing him to a witch) to borrow great ſummes of mony for the ſerving of their pleaſures? But no ſooner are their Maſters come to ruine, but theſe P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſites fall off like lice from a dead corps? Oh! the unſpeakeable miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe that unfaithfull ſervants create to their Maſters.</p>
               <p>How many ſow ſuch diſſentions and quarrells betwene their Maſters and others, (like baſe pickethanks) till thereupon ſutes, yea challenges, duells and bloudſhed follow? Againe, what an unfaithfull humour is it in ſervants, to be more for ſtrangers and their content, then for their
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:45715:172"/> Maſters benefit, giving, lending and beſtowing upon ſuch as they pleaſe, more then either they have leave to doe or thanke for, that hereby they may enhanſe their owne prayſe and account? What truth is there to loſe account with the Maſter, to procure it with the ſtranger, by loſſe of fidelity? How doe many lewd ſervants ſlander fidelity, with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion of covetouſneſſe? They will never bee baſe and worldly (they ſay) to be counted faithfull while they live! If they lived under beggars it were another matter: but as long as they live under rich men they will have it, and let them (in Gods name) keepe a good houſe with that they have! meane time, neither have their Maſters ever the more thanke, nor their buſineſſe better done, beſides the needleſſe waſting of the creature to the value of ſcores yea hundreds through the yeare, not for need, but a baſe cuſtome; and there be ſervants alſo as unthankfull in their conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at others, as theſe are waſtefull themſelves, thinking it rather their reproach, then faithfulneſſe to betray and prevent ſuch pillers and pollers of their Maſters; and when theſe are put away or ſuffer for their falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, how doe they fill the Country with clamours and uproares againſt their innocent Maſters for rejecting them? How common a courſe is it with ſervants to ſpare themſelves in point of paines and providence for their Maſters; their eaſe makes cold in winter, heat in ſummer, to bee te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to them, labour, prevention, watchfulneſſe over the cattell, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and buſineſſe of their Maſters, how burdenſome is it? How little ſerves their turnes? How doe they murmure, if their taske pleaſe them not? What ſhifts have they to avoid it?</p>
               <p>If weather, if travell upon errands and journeies, if worke bee againſt them, how doe they cavill? How ready to thruſt forth others and to grudge (with him in the Goſpel) that the heat of the day lyes upon them more then others?<note place="margin">Gen. 31.40.</note> So farre are they from enduring <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſervice with ill tearmes! If wages pleaſe not, how doe they caſt their Maſters in teeth with other mens ſervants? How full of eye-ſervice are they? If their Maſters ſee them, how nimble at a ſtart are they, but if their backes bee turned, how reſty and lazy? And what melting, ſpoiling, breaking, loſing, and battering the commodities of their Maſters within doores? What neglecting of their cattell, fences, annoyance of other neighbours abroad, ſo that all goes to havocke for lacke of diligence? It were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to mention all: Ye Maſters know better and by more wofull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, (who keep many and of both ſexes in your families) then my ſelf can doe. But oh you unfaithfull ſervants! When I have ſaid what I can, you can cover your falſhood from men, and ſo hope to doe from God: but although the Law take not alway hold upon you, to take away your lives, or to ſtocke, whippe, brand, impriſon or puniſh you here; be ſure of it, the Lord Jeſus will one day judge you for your prankes and rex that you have plaid in your ſervices, either plaguing you with the like ſervants, or elſe pronouncing that terrible doome upon you, Caſt that unfaithfull ſervant into utter darkeneſſe, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth! And yet I have knowne many my ſelfe of both ſexes, who have (many yeares after their ſtealths and cheats committed) come in and (after conviction of conſcience by the word) made outcries, and asked what ſhall we doe? Our Maſters and Miſtreſſes are dead,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:45715:172"/> Their children we know not off: What ſhall our ſtollen goods be done with? How ſhall reſtitution be made? Their conſciences have ſo torne them, and their old morſells have ſo glowed and heartburned in their ſtomacks, that they could have no peace till they could vomit them by ſuch reſtitution as they could make: And whereas others bee more ſtiffe and ſtout then to be ſo convinced; let them know, their ſin and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſleepe not: The Lord ſhall awaken them one day to their coſt, although now they can digeſt any gobbets. But I have held you too long; Here even abruptly I am compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to breake off, reſerving the reſt to the next occaſion. Let us pray, &amp;c.</p>

If they make their conditions,<note place="margin">The pranks of many ſuch ſervants.</note> what liberties doe they covenant for? How doe they (under covert of hearing the word) take courage to themſelves, to ſpend daies after daies in their journeies, companies, and private affaires, to the detriment of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters? They ſeeke not the honour of the Goſpel by their double ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and faithfulneſſe, nor procure a freedome from their Maſters good will, requiting their diligence; but that they have they will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort it as a due belonging to them: So ſaucy and checkmate with their Maſters if religious, ſo ſcornefull and rebellious towards the ignorant, as thinking them too meane for their ſervice, ſo full of tart anſwers, and taunting ſpeeches, ſo cenſorious, uncharitable, unthankefull for kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, boaſting of their owne gifts above theirs, as if they were fitter to rule their Maſters, then they them, diſdainfull to their fellow ſervants, curious about their proviſion and diet, as that they open the mouthes of the bad, to wiſh ſervants rather ignorant and carnall then ſuch; and all by their hypocriticall ſhews of that which is not in them; for were they in truth that they goe for, their hearts would rather be on their right hand then their left, they would rather bee jealous of themſelves, wary leſt any thing ſhould appeare in them repugning to ſubjection and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, labouring by their uttermoſt ſelfe-deniall to winne credit to the Goſpel, by their humble, harmeleſſe and painefull ſervice: this is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to God; the other is baſe and fleſhly: and commonly where a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is faithfull, the Lord ſo honours their faithfulneſſe,<note place="margin">Gen. 39 4.</note> that even (as <hi>Puti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far</hi> ſeeing <hi>Ioſephs</hi> fidelity) betruſt them with their matters above all their fellowes, whereas theſe are leſſe truſted then any, and if they have been truſted by ſuch as knew them not, they have bewraied themſelves to be of a baſtard brood, often running away when their turne is ſerved, and leaving Religion in the lurch and to ſuffer through their baſeneſſe. To theſe I ſay no more, repent in time, diſhonour not the truth of God by your lewdneſſe: I have ſeene few of this ſtraine; but they proved lewd hypocrites and openly debauched in time: Therefore prevent the Lord by ſerious amendment, before hee pull the viſor from your faces, and make your nakedneſſe to appeare to all that behold you, that ſo ſome amends may be made to that truth of God which you have diſhonoured, when as all ſhall ſee that you were arrant varlots, ſuch as Religion can receive no blemiſh from.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By theſe foure or five Rules.</p>
               <p>Firſt, no true faithfulneſſe muſt bee beſide the word, but fetch her warrant &amp; ſtampe from thence. Whatſoever is from any other is ſinfull. There is a wicked and baſe faithfulnes in the world, as we ſee in the raſh attempts of many deſperate ſervants, who (to approve themſelves to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Maſters, ruſh themſelves into ſuch dangers, as they neither have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to overcome, nor calling to undertake.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 23.15.16.</note> See that example of <hi>Davids</hi>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:45715:174"/> ſervants, who to demerit their Maſter, and to publiſh their valour, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke (two or three of them) to breake through an hoſt of enemies to fetch him water. An ungrounded attempt in them, and a worſe motion in <hi>David,</hi> as appeareth after in his ſhaming himſelfe for tempting God, and powring that out for a drinke offering, which was the purchaſe and price of the pretious lives of men. Here ſeemed great loyalty, but it was a will ſervice, not an obeying in the Lord. So many ſervants pickthankes, to indeere themſelves with their proud Maſters, affect to drinke healths in honour to them, and whoſoever refuſes to pledge them, they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give him the ſtab, to defie him, and challenge him into the field. Theſe are double diligently faithfull, which ſervice a good Maſter ſhould abhorre as to hot and to heavy.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>2</label> Secondly, good faithfulneſſe, muſt not (much leſſe) be contrary to a word, for that is doubly irregular. Such was that faithfulneſſe which both <hi>Paul</hi> pleaded for,<note place="margin">So thoſe Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites. 1 Sam. 23.20. 1 Sam. 22.9. 2 Sam. 13.28. 1 Sam 28.7.</note> and (when the reſt abhorred) <hi>Doeg</hi> and his Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites performed, to ſatisfie his bloudy demand, in ſlaying thoſe hundred eighty Prieſts of the Lord: Alſo that treacherous obedience, impoſed by a deſperate Maſter and fulfilled by <hi>Abſolons</hi> ſervants, in the bloudy mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Ammon.</hi> Not unlike whereto was the faithfulneſſe of thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of <hi>Saul,</hi> in directing him to a witch: Such is the ſervice of thoſe neceſſary miſchiefes who hang about the ſleeves of vitious &amp; prodigall gentlemen or ſpendthrifts, who procure them content to their luſts, as mony upon unreaſonable tearmes to fulfill their laviſh expences, harlots to ſatisfie their luſts, debauched gameſters for their pleaſures, attending them, counſelling them, and ſpurring them forward to ride on in their miſerable courſes, till hell devoure them. As that forlorne fellow ſaid, that he was ſo addicted to <hi>Marius</hi> his Maſter, that although he knew his Maſter ought not to bid him burne the Capitoll, yet if he would bid him doe it he would. Such Monſters of faithfulneſſe as to pleaſe the humors of their Maſters, will doe what ever they enjoyne them; if they bee bidden to breake the Sabbath for them, they will doe it, if to ſweare and to forſweare themſelves they are ready, if to ſtabbe or wound an enemy, they are for them: Yea and we have ſuch as write bookes in the juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch ſervants, as obey their Maſters in the breaking of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, as if a ſervant were not bound to have any explicite faith or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of his owne, but onely inwrapped in the boſome of his Maſter who may be an Atheiſt. No, the command is cleare, Exod. 20. Thou and thy wife, thy manſervant and thy maidſervant, &amp;c. Each one muſt have a conſcience for himſelfe to direct his obedience.<note place="margin">Joh. 18.10.</note> If <hi>Peter</hi> in the loyall defence of his Maſter, ſmiting off the eare of <hi>Malchus</hi> had a check (by vertue of a ſpeciall exception in that caſe) what then ſhall the bloudy, cruell and prophane ſervice of ſuch as theſe be deemed?</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, true faithfulneſſe muſt bee ſingle faithfulneſſe, ſincere and ſimplehearted,<note place="margin">Ephe. 6.5.6. Coloſſ. 3.22.</note> from the very heart roote, (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes) not for baſe ends of our owne and avantage. Many there bee who for praiſe, great vayles, to flatter and picke thanke with their Maſters will at the running pull, doe great things, who yet in coole bloud, are the verieſt cowards and ſluggards of all. And many others are like <hi>Gebazi</hi> in their Maſters eye,<note place="margin">2 King. 5.25.</note> who ſo diligent, induſtrous and active as they? Onely to cover
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:45715:174"/> their habituall unfaithfulneſſe, and to get themſelves a name, or to ſerve themſelves into their Maſters opinions and affections; but no ſooner out of ſight, but (as he following after <hi>Naaman</hi>) running after their owne ends.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it muſt not be againſt the Law of piety, or charity, mercy <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>4</label> and compaſſion; It muſt bee good faithfulneſſe.<note place="margin">See Tit. 2.10.</note> For a ſervant to bee faithfull to his Maſter, in the adviſing of him to alienate that from Gods uſe which belongs to him; or for a ſervant in the Market (under colour of faithfulneſſe) to overſell his corne or other commodities to the detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the poore, and beyond his Maſters allowance, are both unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full faithfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it muſt be equall and entire, like it ſelf in all parts of faithfulnes, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>5</label> in all kindes of buſineſſes. Some ſervants if they be ſet about what they like, are very nimble and negotious, but in other that ſures not with their humour, caſt it off. Many alſo will for the time, tugge hard and toile at buſineſſe: But no ſooner have they ſpent their ſtrength in that kinde, but they will run out as faſt in another, and be as couragious &amp; painfull at the pot, or be idle otherwiſe, as they were at their worke, never well till they have drunke themſelves under boord.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Abner</hi> was a faithfull ſervant to the houſe of <hi>Saul:</hi> But why? That he might the more equally have his will, and goe without checke whatſoever villany hee ſhould attempt. And therefore being told of the defiling of <hi>Rizpah</hi> the concubine, his ſervice withered, and he had done his worke. Such are many ſervants now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies; give them their ſwinge, let them have their will, to doe worke without ſubjection, and they promiſe wonders; but goe about to teach them, reprove, correct them, then they ſcorne you, and they will worke no longer. An unbroken, unſubject heart is all at a running pull, and from Selfe, nothing from a principle of equality or ſubjection.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, good faithfulneſſe (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſtiles it) is active, ſtirring, ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>6</label> faithfulneſſe; it is loving and therefore fruitfull and abundant.<note place="margin">Rom. 12.11.</note> It is not enough for a ſervant to pretend himſelfe faithfull by a ſecret habit within unſeene; that is a barren faithfulneſſe which hath no daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters attending her; ſhe muſt not onely beare the minde not to be treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and hurtfull, (for ſo was that unprofitable ſervant, who brought his Maſter the talent in a napkin) But ſhe muſt have all theſe properties which commend a faithfull ſervant: A ſedulous eye to obſerve all occaſions, within or without, tending to remonſtrate the habit within; alſo alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, activity in buſineſſe, skilfulneſſe, providence and prevention to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the way of benefit, to avoid loſſe and dammage, vigilancy, dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, curteouſneſſe, affableneſſe, love, ſubjection and unweariedneſſe. It muſt alway tend to operation and exerciſe, not affecting a careleſſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different &amp; fulſome faithfulneſſe: A looſe ſervant will drive out the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell out of his Maſters corne, or helpe to pull his beaſt out of the ditch, when he is told of it, or gaſtred to it: But an active ſervant will prevent both to his uttermoſt, that howſoever caſualities muſt be, yet they may be few. <hi>Iaacob</hi> bare not onely a fidelity within, as raked under the aſhes, but at all ſeaſons, early, late, in froſt, in heate, was ever upon the wing of circumſpect prevention, and watchfull diligence: And in truth this is the ſoule of faithfulneſſe, going through all and every object of his
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:45715:175"/> ſervice. Try your ſelves (ye ſervants) by theſe and ſuch like markes; and if ye finde (as I feare moſt of ye will) your ſelves behinde hand in any of them,<note place="margin">Concluſion of the Triall.</note> take warning: We Gods Miniſters are told to our faces, oftimes by your Maſters, who grone under theſe burthens, that we are frequent in telling them of their faults; but let your ſervants runne riot. Now the text pulles me by the eare to reach you out your <hi>(Demenſum)</hi> as needfull for you, as your meat and drinke: Such of you as never were faithfull, I heape theſe hot coales upon your heads, and pray God to kindle ſome ſparke or other of this grace in you, that it may appeare that this doctrine is from God, and came ſeaſonably dropping as the ſmall raine or dew: And ſuch of you, as are faithfull, and yet ruſty and overgrowne, in the feare of God, by theſe trialls ſearch out what ſcurſe hath mixt it ſelfe with your goodneſſe,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.9.</note> that that which is crooked may be rectified, and not quite turned out of the way, but purged and <label type="milestone">

                  <note place="margin">Inſtruction. Maſters chuſe your ſervants by this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</note>I haſten to the fourth uſe of inſtruction: And that is to all Maſters who deſire good ſervants. As ye would try an earthen veſſell or a peece of ſilver by the ring of it, ſo chuſe a ſervant by his faithfulneſſe. Maſters never ſo cried out of bad ſervants as now; but when they come to chuſe them, they looke leaſt of all at faithfulneſſe; chuſe not ſervants by other complements onely: Oh! he is a proper man to ſtand about my table, to attend my perſon, a fellow that hath excellent skill in keeping an hawk, a very good huntſman, or he is a very fine fellow at a weapon, of fine acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to dance, to vault, to bowle, to keep me company: Chuſe for no part whatſoever, till you have choſen for fidelity, ſubjection and ſelfe-deniall. <hi>David</hi> could ſay,<note place="margin">Pſal. 101.6.</note> Mine eye ſhould be to the faithfull of the land, he that walketh in a perfect way, he ſhall ſerve me: A ſlanderer, a proud hearted one, a deceitfull perſon, or a lyar ſhall not abide in my ſight. Chuſe ſuch as in whom thy heart may reſt, as well behinde thy backe, as before thy face; undoubtedly the chiefe fault of bad ſervants, is the choice of ill Maſters, whoſe hearts affect not a ſervant for his faithfulneſſe, but for any ſecond hand property. A faithfull drudge pleaſes them better then a faithfull ſervant. But by that time they finde, their families are tainted with uncleanneſſe, their childrens manners corrupted, their goods wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and the reſt of the ſervants poyſoned with drunkenneſſe, ſwearing, when they ſee the wound ſo feſtred that they cannot tell how to cure it, then they cry out, it is time to give over houſekeeping, ere bad ſervants deſtroy all. Nay many bad Maſters abhorre a Puritan ſhould come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their doores, till baſe ſervants have undone them, and then they wiſh themſelves and all Puritans!

Doe you chuſe ſervants thus, and ye are happy, eſpecially your ſelves reſolving to be under God, that you may not abuſe their wills to prophaneneſſe, but uſe them to faithfull ſervice: Even you have hot worke to doe alſo, bee therefore Maſters of their wills; you have Gods Sabbaths to hallow, you have children to be brought up, you have ſometime weighty buſineſſe to ſend them about, great ſummes to bee paid or received: What ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure you in all theſe, ſave faithfulneſſe? Once a knot of Maſters met together, and fell on talking of their ſervants, one boaſted of his, and ſaid, he had one bred well, that could carry himſelfe bravely; another had one could runne a horſe or ride him well; a third had one that would doe worke enough, and ſo forth: One among the reſt ſtepping forth, asked them, but tell me (I pray you) will not theſe ſervants of yours, ſometimes be drunke? Yes, that they would. And would they not teach their Maſters what worke they ſhould ſet them about? Yes. And had they not horrible proud ſtomacks? Yes that they had. Alas! quoth he, you perceive nothing at all: For (upon point) theſe are your Maſters, you are their ſlaves and ſervants. I have ſervants at home, which I confeſſe want ſome of theſe qualities which yours have; but I for my part choſe my ſervants not by that they had ſo much, as by that they wanted, not by having this wit, that skill, preſence, ableneſſe to doe a meſſage, but by their wanting a will of their own, a proud ſtomack, and (ſaith he) I finde my choice beſt. For why? Your ſervants know this and that, but my ſervants will learne any thing they know not; your ſervants can doe ſo and ſo, but mine will doe what I liſt; you have your ſervants fingers ends and outſides at your commands, I have my ſervants will at my girdle, you have ſervants tied by cords of ſhame, feare, praiſe or wages; but I have mine tied by iron chaines of ſubjection and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: my ſervants be not ſo proper fellowes as yours, but I dare truſt them in my cloſet or with my purſe; my ſervants are not ſo quaint of ſpeech as yours, but they are affraid of my diſpleaſure; my ſervants are meaner then yours, but mine will beare a reproofe: And who (thinke you) hath the better ſervants? All concluded this man to have the beſt; but then they would needs know if he had any ſuch to ſpare, that hee might helpe them to ſome? He told them, if he could,<note place="margin">Note.</note> the matter ſtood not in that; they muſt doe as he did; for they uſed to take and chuſe, he uſed to chuſe and take, they met with bad and made them worſe, he, if he met with raw ones, he made them ripe, if with good ones, hee made them better; meaning that the choice of a ſervant, and the rule of a ſervant, muſt make good ones. And ſo let it be (brethren) your courſe
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:45715:176"/> in Gods feare: To get a good ſervant of another mans providing, is no furniture worth the ſpeaking of: Service is no inheritance; good ones may ſoone be gone: But chuſe them and rule them, and ſo have them: Let God be chiefe and make your choice, and beare the chiefe ſway, and then you ſhall have good ſervants; ſubject and faithfull ones, have all qualities infolded in one, if they want skill they ſcorne not to learne, if they faile, they deſire but to be taught, if they obey not, they refuſe no reproofe or puniſhment; for their wills are their Maſters, not their owne, and looke what they faile in, it is by error or infirmity, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe; one ſuch ſervant will doe better ſervice in a yeare, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in two.

               <p>Firſt, be ſure, that as thou thy ſelf lookeſt daily,<note place="margin">Tender to him his ſhare in ſpirituall inſtruction.</note> for the bread of the day from God, ſo tender thou (as thy ſervants ſteward) the <hi>(demenſum)</hi> or portion due to thy ſervant daily; let him ſhare in thine inſtruction, cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing and information in the Lord, with correction and reproofe, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and admonitions, encouragements and promiſes, let him not goe up and downe, ſhifting and graceleſſe, give him ſuch as the Lord hath given thee, with praier for bleſſing daily, and know, that this is as meete for him as his daily food or wages, better unfed then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught. Truſt not thine owne wiſdome, but carry him in thine armes to God, and pray the Lord to waſh him, ſhave off his locks, and pare his nailes, to make him faithfull, to lay his hands upon him and bleſſe him, that ſo thou maieſt have a ſervant of the maker, purged and made uſefull for himſelfe and thee: When thou haſt him tyed to thee by Gods cords, he is ſafe. This whet every day will be no let unto thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, feed him not onely by the eare, but by the eye;<note place="margin">Feed him by the eare and eye too.</note> pull not down that in practice, by an humorous, paſſionate, baſe and ungracious carriage which thou haſt ſet up in him by teaching; for this will make him loath thee and deſpiſe it: But tender unto him an holy, grave, and pure example; walke before him ſo, that Gods authority may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in thee: Stand not ſo much upon thy ſuperiority of fatherhood o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, as wiſdome and reſpect unto him. Above all (as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith) over heare not thy ſervant when he ſpeakes evill of thee, that is, let him ſee that thou art a man who can rule thy paſſions, for thy ſelfe canſt tell, that thou haſt oft offended God in that kinde. This convincingneſſe of thy carriage will breed invincible reverence and reflection of obedience toward thee againe. See that thy ſervant deſpiſe thee not: This will command reverence: Contrarily the heart of a ſervant will ſuggeſt thus; if thou walke baſely, what is matter how I ſerve ſuch a Maſter? What if I filch from him, neglect his worke, ſpeake evill of him and diſhonour him, runne away from him? It is good enough for him, God is juſt: But holy walking awes a ſervant, overpowres his heart, ſhames him, makes him bluſh and puts him to ſilence. This is powerfull not by violence, but by perſwaſion, both in ſight and behinde thy back.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Looke to thy authority. 1. In charges.</note> bee carefull both of thy authority in commanding and in practiſing. For the former, impoſe nothing upon thy ſervant, which the Lord hath not warranted thee by his word. Bee not ſo vile as to digeſt any thing, ſo thou maieſt have thy worke, and thy will done by him: Be thou thy ſelfe alſo under authority, and be a Maſter in the Lord. Thou haſt enough to anſwer for thy ſelfe, endanger not his ſoule alſo, to make thine account more grievous: Stretch not thy conſcience to pervert his, urge him not to breake Sabbaths, ſend him not upon errands that day (as if it were looſe and might be ſpared) fleece not from God; preſſe
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:45715:179"/> him not to make a lye for thee, to ſweare or forſweare for thy ſake, and the like, carry him not with the, to baſe, lewd companies, pleaſures, luſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. For pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</note>So for practice. Ye ſhopkeepers, let not your ſervants behold in you a ſpirit of covetouſneſſe, to obtrude bad wares for good, to belye their goodneſſe, to ſell for too great priſes, falſe weights, ſcant meaſures. Such ſcurffe will ſoke into them, as water into the bowells, and fret like a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. The Divells market is ſo full as it is, by this tradition and exchange from Maſter to ſervant. This is not to be a father but a traitor; for a three penny commodity to betray a ſoule to hell, and (the whiles) to the like practiſe: Such ſtraked roddes laid before ſheepe, will cauſe them to bring forth ſpotted lambes. How many on the gallowes and more in hell, roare and cry out upon ſuch Maſters? Thy life ſhall goe for his, and he in hell groanes for thee to follow, without ſpeciall mercy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. ſo much for this.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Impoſe law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in meaſure.</note>Fourthly, in the obeying of ſuch commands as are lawfull and currant, yet impoſe not tyranny in the meaſure thereof; both in the former and in this latter, ſervants may bee overloaden. When Maſters care not what exceſſe of toile and moile ſervants undergoe, and that out of ſeaſon beyond ſtrength, without due reſt, ſleepe or intermiſſion, they ſhew themſelves no fathers, (for fathers pitty their children) but oppreſſors. Thy ſervant is for thee to uſe, not tire or teare out: Thou muſt not take both fleece and fleſh too, So when that is laid upon the yong and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne (in either ſexe) which belongs to ſtronger armes and ſhoulders to lift, or when a taske is impoſed, which exceeds the skill or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a ſervant, it is an exaction an overdriving of them, more fit for Egyptian taske Maſters, then Chriſtian governours: Take the ſervant in his way and element, it is beſt both for thee and him. So alſo let thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be ſweet and eaſie toward him in his moderate labours, elſe thou wert better lay on more work. For the ſpirit of a Maſter, if inſulting, taunting, chiding, upbraiding, is more heavy and contrary to the ſpirit of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derling, then worke is to the body. A ſervant would not care what hee did for his Maſter, ſo he might have peace and quietneſſe. But a tyrannous ſpirit and wrathfull tongue with implacableneſſe, is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall wearineſſe and dropping to a poore creature. A loving interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, a tender compaſſionate heart, acknowledging with content, the diligence of an inferiour, is as marrow to the bones. Thou couldeſt not abide a froward curriſh ſpirit, a dogged ſervant, anſwering againe, croſſe and diſquieting of thee: Take heed then thou meaſure out to him by the ſame rule, whereby thou wouldeſt have him meaſure out unto thee. Awe him and rule him, ſpare not, and correct errors, yet with a fatherly heart and hand;<note place="margin">1 King. 13.</note> but play not the <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to his ſubjects, who cared not what meaſure he laid on, nor feared what they could requite him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: His little fingers ſhould be heavier then his fathers loynes; but his fathers twelve tribes, turned to become his two tribes, and ſo the mends was in his owne hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Encourage him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</note>Fifthly, if thou ſee thy ſervant extend and inlarge himſelfe for thy content beyond ordinary, conceale not his labour of love, for it is love and bounty of affection which cauſes him ſo to expreſſe himſelf: Elſe he
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:45715:179"/> would ſhrinke in and reſtraine himſelfe. Doe not therefore <hi>Nabal</hi> like, look another way and reject it, but ſee it, encourage and accept it, as thou wouldeſt have Chriſt doe thine. Sometime a little liberty of honeſt exemption refreſhing his wearineſſe, or a little overplus, a teſton or a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings requitall, will do more then all violence. Somewhat hath ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and what a ſervant wouldeſt thou bee to God if thou hadſt all commands and no encouragements?</p>
               <p>Sixtly,<note place="margin">Yeeld him all due protection and ſhelter.</note> the Lord requires thy fatherly protection to ſhield and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard thy ſervant while he is in thy buſineſſe, that none moleſt, wrong or diſcourage him. The Lord promiſes to uphold us while we walke in his way: So muſt we under God protect ſuch as commit themſelves to our ſhelter. Much more then oughteſt thou to ſhew thy ſelf a father and friend in troubles and vexations by enemies, who purſue him in his eſtate or otherwiſe. Moſt of all, if the Lord lay his hand upon him either in minde or body. Moſt Maſters if they finde, that their ſervants grow ſad and ſorrowfull in ſpirit and loaden in conſcience, abandon them preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and are loath to endure the trouble, or to beare the loſſe of ſome little time of hearing the word, conſulting with the Miniſter, whereas ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould be meanes to provide counſell for them. So for body, if a ſervant be hurt, bruſed or lamed in our buſineſſe, or if otherwiſe, the hand of God be upon them, not to leave them to themſelves, but to fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-feele their affliction, to be afflicted with them, and helpe to beare ſome of the burthen which they undergoe. God tries thee in ſuch a caſe, whether thou wilt take all his ſervice, but ſhake off all burden.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">Carry an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hand.</note> carry an equall hand betweene thy ſervants who deſerve well. It is a maine duty of the Maſter to regard thoſe moſt, that deſerve beſt: (for that will provoke the honeſt to emulation, and ſhake off the bad altogether:) But among the equally well deſerving, let not an unequall ſtreame of affection be carryed, and all kindneſſes goe to one as a favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and nothing to others, for that will breed heart burning and ill will, both againſt the Maſter, and amongſt themſelves, and much impeach thy wiſdome and government.</p>
               <p>Eightly, as thou muſt doe for them while they are under thee,<note place="margin">Reſpect them at departure.</note> bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in them the knowledge and skill in thy trade, and the experience which thou canſt afford them; ſo at their departure after long and weary ſervice with thee, doe for them as their occaſions require of thee: The Jew though he were ſold as a ſlave for his time, yet at his diſmiſſion was to have a gratuity paid him, to beginne the hard world withall; either by lending him ſomewhat for a time to occupy, or to helpe him in his marriage, or by commending him to ſome better ſervice, or yeelding him any ſuch countenance or teſtimony as may advantage him. The worlds cry is no penny no <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> if once worke be done, let him looke us no more in the face. But the weldeſerving, require another car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: Thy ſervant hath ſpent his beſt time with thee, therefore it were harſh altogether to neglect him in his decaying time. Let thy counſell and aide be ready for him if he deſire it, in token thou lookeſt at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, as much as thine owne ends. And ſo much for directions: Which if they were duly practiſed, how would they winne and draw the hearts of ſervants to their Maſters? What burthen would they refuſe for ſuch?
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:45715:180"/> As the old men told <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> If thou ſhalt ſpeake kindely to theſe people, they will be thy ſervants for ever. <hi>Naaman</hi> here, is not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing called father by his ſervants, who are as thankefull to requite his reſpect: And the truth is, he might account the cure as wrought by their perſwaſion, under God and his Prophet. And ſtill I ſay as before, the fatherhood of Maſters, would breed childlike faithfulneſſe in ſervants, and doubtleſſe the many clamors of both ſorts againſt each other, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king theſe counſells, would much what be ſtopped. And ſo much for this point alſo, added to the former by a neceſſary coherence: So much alſo for the firſt qualification of ſervants and Maſters faithfulneſſe and reſpect.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond thing in the perſons at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting: Their care for their Maſter with ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe and wiſdome.</note>Now followeth the ſecond thing to be noted in the perſons attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and that is their due behaviour of themſelves in the attempt making. Which I noted to conſiſt in a compound of ſundry vertues, eſpecially of wiſdome, tenderneſſe and ſeaſonableneſſe: I will not handle them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part but altogether; yet I would open them briefly for the better groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the doctrine.</p>
               <p>And firſt, their wiſdome appeares in this, that they mix awe and feare with love, a due reverence compounded of both: Some would rather have diſcovered diſdaine of his folly and rage; but even in theſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of his, yet they bewray their reverence of him. Father is a noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of feare and love.<note place="margin">The ground of the point opened.</note> As if they had ſaid, your are our Maſter, we your ſervants; wee come now to treate with you in a caſe concerning your owne good; yet wee underſtand our ſelves to be inferiours, and that the perſon which we ſuſtaine will not beare any boldneſſe or ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cineſſe: Let our words therefore be accepted, and wee ſhall thinke our paines well beſtowed: commonly men thinke reverence is ſuperfluous in the caſe of welwiſhing to others; we may be as bold and uſurping as we liſt: no, but even in this alſo, very great humbleneſſe and loyalneſſe is required.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they are very tender, meeke and mercifull to their Maſters ſoule and preſent condition, and becauſe it needed ſome expoſtulating and conteſting (for the better piercing into him) ſo yet they ſaw, that his froward paſſion would not endure any harſhneſſe or ſharpeneſſe from them; and therefore they put on a meeke ſpirit, inſtead of (Maſter) call him (Father) ſugering the bitter potion they were to miniſter, they come with the heart of a Lion for courage and reſolution, to thruſt in the looſe joynt into his place, yet with the hand of gentleneſſe and ſmoothneſſe: Even as Chyrurgians muſt doe to broken bones. Wrath added to wrath, would have cauſed madneſſe: But this mildeneſſe brake the dint of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they adde ſeaſonableneſſe to both: Angry men we ſay, muſt be waited on till the humour is over: But now the caſe required preſent advice. For if their Maſter had ſet ſpurres to horſe, and made away homeward, who knowes whether any opportunity would have beene offered them to treate with him? But now while the Prophet was at hand, and the cure in ſome hope, it was their ſeaſon to ſtrike in with him, and to prevent future danger. Now therefore they rather chuſe to take their time, and to alay his wrath with much moderation of heart toward him, then to waite for the cooling of it while remedy was paſt. All theſe
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:45715:180"/> three come to one, that is a due and diſcreet behaviour in attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to heale one who was diſtempered and paſſionate: If they had vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently driven out one naile with another, and taken him to taske thus, Sir, you ſhew your ſelfe ſcarſe a man, not wiſe enough to ſee what buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe you are about, you are mad with your owne ſhadow, and who ſhall be wiſe for one, who will needs play the foole againſt himſelfe? Wee for our parts, are reſolved to give you over, if you bee at this point, goe home hardly, and repent at leaſure, &amp;c. Alas what had come of it! ten to one a further enraging of him, and a ſplitting him againſt the rocke of his owne paſſion, and making the diſeaſe incurable: This therefore they ſaw was no courſe to be taken with him, and therefore they melt him with mercy, rather then batter him with terror, ſaying, Father, if the Prophet had ſaid ſome hard thing, wouldeſt not have done? &amp;c. They cover their expoſtulation with ſweet ſpeech, as one that would lap up a pill in the pap of an apple.</p>
               <p>The point then will be this, It is no eaſie taske for any,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctrine.</hi> It is no eaſie taske to adviſe rightly in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes.</note> to encounter them aright who are in any diſtemper: or thus, To ſpeak to them that are diſtempered in ſpirit to any good purpoſe, is a worke of ſome difficulty. And as touching the ground of this point, out of the text it is evident, that it was difficult for theſe poore ſervants thus to encounter their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. For (to ſay truth) it was none of their owne worke, but the Lords in them, who ſet them on. As is was ſaid of <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinees,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam 2.25.</note> it was from the Lord that they ſhould not heare the counſell of their father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he meant to deſtroy them; and of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 13.</note> it was from the Lord that he ſhould not heare the voice of his old counſellors, that ſo he might fall: So it was from the Lord that <hi>Naaman</hi> ſhould take counſell of his ſervants, not to turne away in a rage, but goe to Jorden and waſh, that ſo he might be healed; and therefore much more the meanes were from the Lord whereby this was effected. The Lord ſent them forth with meet furniture, and cauſed them to prevaile, which elſe would not have beene.</p>
               <p>For theſe three qualities of wiſdome, tenderneſſe and ſeaſonable fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> are no common gifts either in ſervants or Miniſters or any others, for the redreſſe of the afflicted in ſoule and ſpirit. Every one will jangle and prate of them that are troubled; it is eaſie to play the fooliſh, the harſh and unſeaſonable counſellors; but wiſe, meeke and ſavoury counſell, is (as they ſay of truth) hidden deepe in the earth, and hardly digged out. I will ſay a word or two of the text, and then enlarge my ſelfe further to the point.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for inferiours to encounter a ſuperiour,<note place="margin">Amplifying of the point out of the text.</note> a Noble man &amp; of great ſpirit, was a thing of ſome difficulty, eſpecially in ſuch a perverſe temper as he was in. Equals to equals, or ſuperiours to inferiours carry an hand of greater authority, then inferiours to their betters: Becauſe the ſpirit of the great ſoone riſe againſt the meane, as if they thought themſelves deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed. And therefore the Lord forbids every one to meddle with the elder or ancient, by reproofe, but to exhort them as fathers;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.1.</note> they will not eaſily beare it; they muſt heare of their fault by implication as <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> here doth.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, diſtemper is a kinde of ſuperiority of it ſelfe, becauſe it
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:45715:181"/> is lofty and proud. So ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi> Prov. 21.24. Proud and hauty is his name &amp;c. For the while, that a diſtemper laſteth, the verieſt underling thinkes himſelfe ſomebody, when as in truth he is leſſe then himſelfe: How much more then, when ſtate is joyned with it, as here? Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of ſpirit, lookes at no reaſon, arguments, carriage for the preſent: <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi> himſelfe (in a lawfull diſtemper) yet being tranſported,<note place="margin">2 King. 3.15.</note> was faine to call for a minſtrell; by the harmony of whoſe muſicke his ſicke ſpirit was a little brought to it ſelfe. This for the Text. But now for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, much more may be ſaid for the proofe and explication thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Proofes.</note>Take ſome Scriptures firſt, and then ſome Reaſons. See Act. 9. <hi>Paul</hi> (then <hi>Saul</hi>) was in a deadly diſtreſſe of ſpirit after his caſting downe: the Lord bids <hi>Ananias</hi> ariſe and go to counſell him. But what ſaith <hi>Ananias?</hi> Oh Lord, I have heard ſay of this man, hee hath beene ſuch and ſuch a one, a perſecutor, blaſphemer! <hi>q.d.</hi> If he now be to be dealt with, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds my ability. I know not, but he may doe me hurt for my love. No (faith the Lord) he is a choſen veſſell to beare my name, goe and be not afraid. Well, he went, and how doth he encounter him? Very merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and reſpectively: Even as <hi>Naamans</hi> ſervants here doe, alleniates his diſtemper, grates not upon his ſad heart, addes not ſorrow to ſorrow, oppoſes him not, upbraids him not for his former cruelties, qualifies his feares, eaſes him of thoſe aggravations of horror which had ſunke him, brought him to the cleare ſight of the promiſe, and mercifully reaches him out the hand, Brother <hi>Saul</hi> receive thy ſight both of ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Was there not ſome difficulty in the harping upon the right ſtring, if God had not guided his hand? So <hi>Paul</hi> in the caſe of the excommunicate Corinthian, how wiſely, tenderly and ſeaſonably is he faine to carry himſelfe?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. with 2 Cor 6 7. 2 Cor. 11.29.30.</note> He was at firſt, very violent with him: After, ſeeing how he humbled himſelfe, how wary he is, leſt he overdrive, and ſo put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an extremity? Oh! ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> he hath beene caſt downe ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; I dare not uſe mine office to deſtroy, but to ſave. Therefore rather comfort and encourage ſuch a one, then adde ſorrow to ſorrow! See Eſay 50.4. The Lord Jeſus was annointed by God his father, as with the oile of gladneſſe beyond meaſure; ſo in ſpeciall of Propheſie: The Lord God (ſaith he) hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I might ſpeake a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary. So ſaith <hi>Iob,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 33. If an interpreter one of a thouſand be ſent unto him, &amp;c. The worke of a man (who is one of a thouſand) is no common work. Read alſo <hi>Elihu</hi> his breaking in upon <hi>Iob,</hi> an ancient man, (himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yong) he comes in with his preface, to avoid envy, confeſſes his youth and unfitneſſe of himſelfe, to deale in the matter: But (ſeeing God had ſet him on) what doth he? He tells him, that he will not be as his three friends had beene, an accuſer and cenſurer of him, nor yet an excuſer of his errors and misbehaviour, but he would be to him an equall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall judge, and as his owne ſoule, and as in the ſight of God hee would wiſh him to bee. No eaſie matter it is then to bee an <hi>Elihu</hi> to an afflicted <hi>Iob. Paul</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>Timothy,</hi> how a Miniſter of God ought to carry himſelfe toward the diſtempered,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.</note> ſaith, He muſt not be prejudicate and raſh, but patient and long ſuffering towards ſinners, waiting if at any time the Lord will give them repentance to life.<note place="margin">Eſay 42.3.</note> It is ſaid of the Lord
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:45715:181"/> Jeſus, that hee was the beloved of God, in whom he delighted, and whom he qualified for the nonce to preach glad tidings, to relieve the poore priſoners and captives, &amp;c. And what did hee? Surely he would not breake the bruſed reed, nor quench the ſmoking flax. His voice was not heard, he cried not in the ſtreets, he was a lambe, dumbe before the ſhearer. That is a moſt compaſſionate and tender helper, who by his owne afflictions, had learned to be full of ſympathy, and to be afflicted in all the afflictions of the people.</p>
               <p>But I haſten to Reaſons. The firſt is this. It is no eaſie thing to carry <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> our ſelves wiſely toward them who are but naturally diſtempered, as with wrath, diſcontent and paſſion, in common and outward reſpects; not onely if the parties be meerely carnall, but alſo although Religious. For anger is a madneſſe, and who ſhould deale with mad men? Doe they not thinke that their rage becomes them? Doth not the foole caſt arrowes and deadly darts, and ſay, he is in ſport? That is, doth hee feele or underſtand himſelfe to be as hee is? Who ſhould deale with a mad man who is ſo wiſe in his owne opinion, that for the time preſent he thinkes he can bee mad with reaſon? Thus was <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 25. in the caſe of <hi>Nabal,</hi> he was ſo enraged, (thinking he had ſome cauſe of it) that without any more adoe, hee would needs command all his men to gird on their ſwords, and to diſpatch him and all his houſe, both guilty and innocent. And had not the Lord encountred him by a rare perſon, how hardly had he beene diſſwaded from his attempt? Well then, if meere naturall diſtemper of wrath be ſo hardly cured, how much more ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diſtempers, which lye farre deeplier ſeated in the ſpirit, and are of a farre more intricate nature? Such was <hi>Naamans</hi> here with <hi>Eliſha,</hi> though the diſeaſe were bodily.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it appeares to be a difficult worke, becauſe it hath poſed <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> the wiſeſt men to performe it well. Even one part of it is hard (and how much more all) I meane to diſcerne of the cauſe of the diſtemper.

For till there be no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and till abſolute neceſſity and deſperateneſſe of ſtate compell them, men are very loath to make out, and diſcover what troubles them: They love to bite in their diſeaſes, and keepe them to themſelves, either through vanity, hoping they ſhall be better in time and ſhake off their diſtempers, (which yet rankle within them as feſtred ſores) and yet uſe no meanes.<note place="margin">Loathneſſe to adviſe till ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity compell them.

               <p>For the former, it is hard to diſcerne of ſpirituall diſtempers wiſely;<note place="margin">1. Diſcerning them. Pſal. 41.1.

For what availes it to lay an outward plaiſter upon a ſoule ſickneſſe, or to give ſpirituall counſell to a worldly ſorrow and a carnall malady? When the body is eaſed, then the ſoul ſtill remaines in her diſtemper, and never complaines.

For <hi>Naamans</hi> diſtemper (much what) was a carnall moodineſſe and rage: And the ſervants who encountred it, were inferiours, yet proſpered in their attempt, becauſe qualified for the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>In the firſt reſpect, let it be Inſtruction,<note place="margin">1. Inſtruct. 1. Branch. Anger muſt be pacified with meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. 1 Pet. 2.23. Prov. 26.5.</note> to all who have to deale with diſtempered paſſions, that they requite not evill with evill. Let the ſame minde be in us, which was in our Lord Jeſus: of whom Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, When he was reviled he reviled not againe, when he ſuffered, he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not, but committed himſelfe to him that judgeth righteouſly: And the like hath beene the practice of all Gods Saints, except (in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes we be compelled to anſwer a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt he encreaſe in his pride and rage, and ſo grow to implacableneſſe:) Thus <hi>Ipta</hi> handled thoſe proud Ephramites, who would be anſwered with no reaſon,<note place="margin">Judg. 12.4.</note> but ſhewed that they came with proud and diſdainfull hearts to ſpeake deſperately in their wrath:<note place="margin">An exception.</note> When hee ſaw them more enraged with his equall anſwers, he fell to blowes and cooled their courage with ſlaying two and forty thouſand of them. And the truth is, none but dogged hearts and treacherous ſpirits will be incenſed by ſoftly ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For the Lord hath appointed it as a quencher of the cauſe of wrath; Pride and Selfe are the matter and cauſe of this diſtemper, and that which kills theſe, kills the effect. Mildeneſſe and love will ſhame pride and put it to confuſion; and when an angry man ſees his wrathfull face and ſparkling eyes in a quiet glaſſe, he is aſtoniſhed and afraid of himſelfe; but if he ſee himſelfe in another which is like himſelfe he is enraged to try who ſhall ſhout furtheſt in the Divells bow. None ſave a <hi>Iudas</hi> will be provoked with mildeneſſe: And therefore it is juſt, that ſuch ſhould be left to the fruit of their owne hands, to reape as they ſow: But uſually it is otherwiſe; and ſo have the Saints practiſed: Not onely ſuch as have ſtood in feare of the angry (as it ſtood <hi>Abigail</hi> upon to pleaſe <hi>David</hi> with faire words and with kinde preſents,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.</note> becauſe ſhe ſaw him armed to make havoke) but even ſuch as had power to revenge themſelves. Thus <hi>Gede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> when he could have ſerved thoſe Ephramites as <hi>Ipta</hi> after did, yet he choſe rather to appeaſe them by faire ſpeech. Alas ſaith hee!<note place="margin">Judg. 8.3.</note> you ſhall not need to grudge me this victory; for what is my ſtrength and prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe to yours? And who knowes not <hi>Ephraim</hi> to be chiefe of the tenne tribes? Or what is the whole vintage of <hi>Abiezer,</hi> to the after gatherings of <hi>Ephraim?</hi> Oh this pleaſed them well! and ſo their fierceneſſe abated.</p>
               <p>So <hi>David</hi> when he had the advantage of <hi>Saul</hi> twice,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24.4.</note> both when hee was aſleepe and tooke away the pot of water from him and his ſpeare; another time when he cut off the lap of his garment and came after him, ſaying, I could have ſlaine thee this day, and inſtead of cutting thy lap, cut thy throate, but thy life was pretious to me. This for the time ſhaked his fury and wildefire; and although it could not wholly quench it, yet his end was moſt deſperate, as commonly theirs is, whoſe rage a calme anſwer and milde uſage will not qualifie.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Iaacob</hi> in his returne from <hi>Laban,</hi> foreſeeing <hi>Eſau</hi> his old grudge,<note place="margin">Gen. 33.13.</note> ſets himſelfe in an exquiſite manner to appeaſe him; firſt, by gifts, then by great titles and humble carriage, whereby he turned off that rage
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:45715:184"/> which elſe might have brake out, if hee had oppoſed him by violence. Oh! ſuch <hi>Abigails, Davids, Gideons</hi> and <hi>Iaacobs</hi> are much wanting and almoſt out of the world!<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.18.</note> Now men have juſtled out Divinity, and made a mocke of it by their brave ſtomacks, maintaining that a man ſhall bee ſo much reputed amongſt others, as he reputes himſelfe and ſtands upon his tearmes; and he that puts up one wrong or reproach provokes two: And it is true, if we be ſuch indeed as ſtand to our owne and the worlds judgement and barre, appealing from Chriſts; we may take our courſe, goe on without let, till ſhame and repentance, and perhaps meeting with our matches doe compell us: But if Chriſts voice will prevaile, and wee will ſtand to his tribunall, hee hath told us plainly, ſuch cowards and white-livers we muſt bee, (and yet Chriſtianity makes us rather as bold as Lions in a juſt defence) if we will be his, read Matth. 44.5. You heard them ſay of old (marke, revenge is the old Religion, though in a new cut) Thou ſhalt love thy friend and hate thine enemy, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, wrath for rage: But I ſay unto you (marke the voice of the new Goſpel of peace) love your enemies, doe for them that ſpite you, and ſpeake evill of you and hate you: Turne the other cheeke to him that ſmites you on the one cheeke. That thus you may be children of your father in heaven, who lets his raine and ſunne fall upon the ground of the bad, as well as the good. And this is the ſame with that of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 12. If thine enemy hunger, thirſt or be naked, give him meate, drinke and cloathing,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> thus heaping hot coales upon his head, recompencing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill with good.</p>
               <p>And leſt ye ſhould think there is one Divinity for plaine folke, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Courtiers, Gentlemen and brave ſparkes of hot and noble bloud; looke (I pray) upon <hi>Eliſha's</hi> Divinity which hee brought to <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Court;<note place="margin">2 King. 6.21.</note> when he had brought the Aramites blindefold to Samaria, hee askes them, My father ſhall I ſmite them? But the Prophet anſwers, No, ſmite them whom thou takeſt in the warre, kill not in coole bloud, ſet bread and meate rather before them and feaſt them, and ſo ſend them home to their Maſter, and ſo he did, and the bands of Aram came no more that yeare. It was good policy and Religion too. And no doubt but many of our braving and lofty ſtomacks, when they have met with the affronts of them whom they have provoked (as commonly boaſters alway goe by the worſe) then they wiſh they had beene wiſer and held in their ſtomack ill afterward: But I doubt many of our challengers and duellers, if they were put upon the enemy in a pitcht battell, and in Gods way, would prove like thoſe ſparkes ſpoken of in Judg. 9. I meane <hi>Gaall</hi> and his brethren, who asked, who is <hi>Abimelec?</hi> But when they ſaw him, their hearts fainted, and they were beaten downe.</p>
               <p>To conclude, let this generall Inſtruction (brethren) reach to all ſtates, perſons, occaſions: Let the word dwell in us plentifully in all wiſdome to guide us in our courſe. The word is, anſwer not a foole in his folly, leſt thou be like him. The patient man is better then he who is haſty in his ſpirit and in his matters. He that overcomes himſelfe, is better then he that overcomes a City.<note place="margin">Ecleſ. 7.8. Rom. 12.19.</note> Be ſlow to ſpeake, and ſlow to wrath. Here be the rules. If the former examples of Saints perſwade not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, let the practiſe of theſe heathen ſervants, ſhame and upbraid us: You
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:45715:184"/> husbands and wives, remember Satan is alway at your elbow, if he can dſtemper you, quickly will the whole houſe be diſtempered and out of frame, and your examples will fret like a canker.</p>
               <p>Doe therefore as wiſe <hi>Abigail</hi> did to drunken <hi>Nabal,</hi> (for drunkenneſſe and rage are both madneſſe) ſhe gave way to him while hee was in his cups and in his jollity of feaſting, but next day when wine was out, and wit in, ſhe told him of his baſe diſtemper, and then he was tame. So do not take your husbands or wives weapon out of their hand ſuddenly to wound him or her. If one rage, let the other pray and be innocent, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Lord will do thee good for their wrath. Conſider each other, the party in coole bloud, conſider of the other party, as of a man in drink, prevented by his paſſion that maſters him: Doe not now adde oile to the flame, and drunkenneſſe to thirſt: But remember, now God tries me! Theſe words are as ſtinging as fiery darts, this tongue is ſet on fire by hell, but now doth the Lord vex every veine in my heart to ſee what mettall I am made of: If now I liſten to my luſt and outſhoot the Divell, I may ſet a marke upon my ſelfe and be aſhamed: but if I can poſſeſſe my ſoule with patience now, and keepe my fort ſtrong, I ſhall ſhew my ſelfe a man, or woman ſtronger then a conquerour.<note place="margin">Luke 21.11.</note> I will deny my ſelfe therefore and take away anger from mine eyes,<note place="margin">Ecleſ. 11.10.</note> and diſtemper from my heart: I will ſeaſonably give over ſtrife leſt it become as a fire broken out, or as the barres of a Palace. Better ſo, then let your ſhames breake out to others, and ſo be faine to put your quarrells to arbitration, and then your ſelves ſhall be the firſt that repent it.

Yet ſo it may fall out that neceſſity may put ſome calling upon an inferiour, as when there be no ſuperiours or equalls preſent, when ſilence would embolden the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender much, when the glory of God lies at the ſtake unavoidably, and eſpecially when the grace of the reprovers wiſdome may be like to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match both his owne meanneſſe and the others ſtoutneſſe. Otherwiſe
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:45715:185"/> there had need be great caution leſt inferiours rather run themſelves into the ſuſpition of ſawcineſſe, receive great affronts and diſcouragements, (if not wrongs) from the reproved, leſt alſo the offender be more hardned in his ſin,<note place="margin">A caution.</note> and the ordinance with the fruit of it be diſhonoured and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.

The ſetling of a diſtreſſed heart by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy highly to be priſed.</note> No: To ſpeake to the heart is Gods worke, whoſoever be the inſtrument; and none can create the fruit of the lippes, ſave onely hee that firſt created and formed the body of the earth, and breathed into it the breath of life. We Miniſters may ſpeake to the eare, diſcerne and adviſe, urge, anſwer doubts and convince, but the ſpirit of grace which annointed the Lord Jeſus to bee the Prophet of his Church, can carry thoſe words into the ſoule, and caſt them there as ſeed, and give them a body and being; altering ignorance, doubting, feares, deadneſſe, bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, inſenſibleneſſe, infidelity, heavineſſe, into light, reſolution, hope, life, liberty, feeling faith and comfort. He that ſaid, lift up thy voice as a trumpet and convince my people of their ſinnes: and againe, Comfort ye my people, comfort them at the heart; meanes not, that we ſhould pierce into and reach the heart (for we cannot get to it) but that we bee the meſſengers of peace and glad tidings: God onely muſt by his Spirit convince, Joh. 16.9. and he onely can carry conſolation through thoſe manifold turnings and crooked windings of the ſoule, even home and cloſe to the heart rootes. He onely can ſay, My doctrine ſhall droppe as dew,<note place="margin">Deut. 32 1.</note> and as the ſmall raine wetting at the roote. Therefore whoſoever
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:45715:185"/> thou art, here in this audience whom ever the Lord hath cauſed to breake through the hoaſt of diſcouragements, and to conſult with the Miniſter, ſincerely aiming at the true ends of counſell, and hath alſo met with thy ſpeciall diſeaſe, ſpoken to thy heart ſo, that it hath gotten a reall bottome out of the word and promiſe, for the ſole of her foote to reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt feare and doubting: Oh! learne to priſe ſuch a favour above all treaſures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eliſha</hi> was ſent but to one leper, as many as there were in Iſrael; and did not he eſteeme that priviledge? Let the 15.16. and 17. verſes wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for him: So the Miniſter of God goes to hundreds of ſicke and afflicted ones: But perhaps he is ſent in the ſpirit of counſell and ſealing up of peace through pardon to a very few: It is their portion to whom it pertaines; thoſe muſt partake it who can receive it, and only ſuch can be thankefull. What is the cauſe why we comfort ſo many through the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven yeare, of whom perhaps wee heare no more againe ever after? Our feete are not beautifull to the moſt of them; they never imbraced the power of truth, they deſpiſed the counſell of God for their ſalvation, and the conſolations of God ſeemed ſmall things unto them: They have got that they came for, a kinde of ſtopping of their outcries of conſcience, their wounds are kept ſweete and doe not rankle (as they thinke) they can now follow their buſineſſe, and goe about the world at their pleaſure, pleaſing themſelves with that the Miniſter hath ſaid unto them: And that no man ſhall pull from them, for it pleaſes them well to heare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be under the condition of grace, that faith belongs to them, that the leaſt deſire of faith is faith: But alas! They are comforted all at once, their comfort growes not as their doubts grow, they are not unſatisfied in ſeeking it, they are not afraid to deceive the Miniſter about their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſo deceive themſelves: But a dead comfort they are content withall, and if any call it into queſtion, they ſtoppe his mouth with this, the Miniſter of God comforted mee with ſuch and ſuch texts. But oh thou beaſt! It appeares ſince by thy baſe and common courſe that the Miniſter of God was deceived in thee, thy gloſing and ſemblance of ſorrow, thy ſelfe-loving complaints, and deſires, and thirſtings, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, and thy ſelfe alſo. Were that Miniſter to conferre againe with thee, upon due knowledge of thee, he would profeſſe thou deceivedſt him and thine owne ſoule much more; for hee never comforted thee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then upon ſuch conditions as thou never hadſt: But I digreſſe too much.</p>
               <p>In all theſe reſpects I ſay,<note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> who ever thou art who canſt unfainedly ſpeak it, that God by the Miniſter hath met with thy ſinne, humbled thee for it, let in ſome glimpſe of mercy to ſtay thee for a time; not ſuffered thee to reſt there while thou couldeſt ſee how that light encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as the day, and how it bred in thee ſuch affections, as brought thee to ſettle upon the free and eternall ſatisfaction of Chriſt for pardon and peace: I ſay, in what poore meaſure ſoever theſe have beene wrought, yet thou haſt felt ſcales to fall from thine eyes, deadneſſe from thy heart and grace to enter by degrees, till thou ſaweſt cauſe to reſt in ſome ſort upon the naked love of the promiſer: Thou haſt infinite cauſe to bleſſe God all daies of thy life. I will not now bid thee beware of forgetting
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:45715:186"/> the Miniſter of God, and paſſing him by as a ſtranger (as hypocrites do) for thou ſhalt priſe him above the parents of thy fleſh; doe otherwiſe if thou canſt,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> he ſhall bee ſo deare to thee, that thou ſhalt pull out thine eies to doe him good, yea eſteeme him as one of a thouſand; and there ſhall be a perpetuall aſcent of praiſes to God from thine altar, it ſhall ſmoke continually; and although thine edge may blunt, yet thy metall of admiration and thankes ſhall abide for ever. Conſider tenne miſcarry to one that proſpers by counſell; they returne to their old ſloth, eaſe and diſtempers, they relapſe to their worldlineſſe, ſelfe love, and lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a clod; If then thou haſt beheld the wiſdome, and ſavoured the good of the ordinance, try thy ſelfe throughly, as touching the fruit it hath wrought in thee, take not glaſſe for gold, and pebbles for pearles, be ſure the Lord have thee in a cord ſurely bound to him, for playing the ſtarter and time ſerver (as moſt doe) and I ſay, give over the Lord if thou canſt; But ſurely while theſe coales are in thy boſome thou ſhalt be burnt, and as long as thou haſt this treaſure about thee, thou canſt not, wilt not chuſe but bee exceedingly thankefull and cheerefull.

Doe not imagine the art of that to bee ſo eaſie (as moſt Miniſters doe) the worke whereof is ſo difficult, and the fruit whereof is ſo pretious!

I would not adviſe any to do ſo, (whom God holdes in) but I would have none (of what parts ſoever) to thinke this an eaſie gift; ſuch an one as will flow from the meere habit of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſtudies of Divinity, or paines in preaching alone: Diſcerning of leproſie was a peculiar skill of the high Prieſt.<note place="margin">Read Levit. from the 12. to the 15.</note> So this is a ſpeciall gift by it ſelfe, obtained by ſtudy of thine owne heart, acquaintance with the infinite windings and ſubtilties of it, by much ſelfe-deniall, much ſtrife in applying the promiſe: Alſo much experience is required to judge aright of the ſtates of the diſtreſſed, much reading and through acquaintance with the Scriptures, much meditation and conference, much praier both ordinary and extraordinary muſt prevaile with God for it;<note place="margin">Helpes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to it.</note> yea commonly it is the gift of ſuch as have beene much buffeted with temptations, humbled and tozed under Satan and their owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; ſuch as have wraſtled much with the Lord for a bleſſing, and halted upon it, that they might not be puffed up, but learne to be willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under infirmity. I ſay, it is the gift, for the moſt part, of ſuch as have laboured to deſtroy their ſenſe and reaſon in and by faith and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, holding the realneſſe of it from the truth of the promiſer, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fleſh ſay to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Yea it requires great love, a meeke and tender heart, burning with the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:45715:186"/> weake, to be all in all for Gods ends, loſing our owne in his, and cleaving to the worke for Gods cauſe unweariedly, againſt diſcouragements whatſoever. I exclude no other learning, arts, tongues, for a Divine, but for this part of Miniſtry, I ſay, there is another courſe to be taken for it. Alas! who ſhould wonder that there ſhould be few counſellors (under the Lord Jeſus whoſe office it is, Eſay 8.) of diſtreſſed ones? Nay, that in ſtead of comforters, there ſhould bee ſo many diſcouragers and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable comforters? Alas! there are few that taſte the method which I have ſpoken of. If it were but this one thing alone, it might eaſily reſolve us of this wonder, even to think how few there be who diſcerne aright of ſoul diſeaſes, or the eſtate of the poore, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks! How eaſie is it to be cheated by the cunning tricks of baſe hypocrites, who come onely to ſerve their owne turnes? How had blinde <hi>Ahija</hi> been deceived by <hi>Ieroboams</hi> wife, but for God?<note place="margin">1 King 4.4.5.</note> I profeſſe of late there came to my ſelfe a drunken companion for comfort! and if God had not ſpecially armed me beforehand, and diſcovered his ſpirit, I might have beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in him, and when he was gone, hee reported me to be unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table! But all that knew him, knew that he ſlandred me! Who is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for theſe things? If God keepe the ſtate of a poore ſoule from us (as <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid of the Shunamites dead child) how ſhall we ſpeake to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but patter?<note place="margin">2 King. 4.27.</note> How many worthy and wiſe ones have beene miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? (for I ſpeake not of ſuch as will thruſt themſelves upon the worke, when they want all manner of meetneſſe, and ſo will goe through ſtitch and ſay ſomewhat, though to the banning and perverting of the parties, rather then the ſetling and comforting) How hard is it often to judge of ſorrow, whether it bee worldly or godly? Have not both as deepe pangs one as other? And although it be ſpirituall, yet how hard to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne ſorrow comming from the terrors of the conſcience, or ariſing from the hope of the Goſpel? How eaſie is it, out of a preſent merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of heart to one in trouble, to goe raſhly to worke, and to apply plaiſters to a freſhly bleeding wound?</p>
               <p>How many loaden wretches with the guilt of their daily revolts and lewdneſſe, come roaring to a Miniſter for eaſe, meerly from an horror of heart, no way deſirous to bee broken off from their courſe in evill, but onely from the hell of their conſcience, which if they were rid of, they would returne to their vomit worſe then ever? Who would thinke bleeding at the arme, would ſtanch bleeding at the noſe? That is, that it were a medicine for ſuch a one to bee drawne into more true horror by the word, for ſinne as it is ſinne: And yet no other remedy will eaſe ſuch a one: Who is able to diſcerne diabolicall injections (which may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the unnaturalneſſe, hideouſneſſe, dogging and pertinacy of them, and the like,) from evills of our owne wilfully committed and polluting the ſoule? For why? Both may ſeem to cleave to the ſoule, the one as faſt as the other. And ſo I might bee endleſſe. I ſpake of a great many of theſe difficulties in the third Reaſon. Is it then an eaſie thing to ſpeake a word in due ſeaſon to one that is weary? No doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, let it be a caveat to all Gods Miniſters whom this worke concernes, as not to put it off, (being one of the maine peeces
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:45715:187"/> of our calling) ſo neither to ruſh upon it ſuddenly and without due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration: uſe thoſe directions before named, and joyne this laſt, to ſeek of God a wiſe diſcerning ſpirit, (for that gift is not wholly abſent from the Church) to put a difference betweene things that differ: Which meanes being uſed, and love ſetting all on worke as the chiefe mover, it ſhall not be difficult to doe that in time and years, which perhaps at firſt ſeemed hard. God will bleſſe experience, and make this yoke (for ſo it is to the fleſh) eaſie, and this burthen light. I would have come to the other branch of the caveat to the people. But time cuts mee off: muſe the while of theſe, and we ſhall proceed to the reſt the next time, if God will. Let us pray &amp;c.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Could not (brethren) the laſt Lecture, finiſh the point of the Religious ſervice done by theſe ſervants to their Maſter; wherein I obſerved the qualification of their perſons with love and lenity, to adviſe him for his good. I have opened the doctrine already at large, and made ſome generall Uſes, and ſome in ſpeciall. The laſt was Admonition to the Miniſters, with the which I have done. The next followeth now, as God ſhall guide us: Concerning both Miniſters and people, and that is exhortation: Therefore (brethren) if the worke of ſpeaking to the weary ſoule bee ſo difficult: Firſt, let me ſpeake to you that are to be comforted, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive inſtruction by the Miniſter of God.<note place="margin">The people muſt beware leſt they turne away from counſell of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> And the thing to which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you in generall is, that both you beware leſt feare or ſinfull ſhame hold you off from counſell, and then that ye fitly apply your ſelves to the advice of the Miniſter of God, not to hinder, but to further the worke of your owne ſoules. If a man that hath a bone out of joynt could helpe the arme of the Surgeon (who wants ſtrength) to thruſt it in againe; how gladly would he aſſiſt him in ſo hard a worke, rather then by his wilfulneſſe abide long in his paine? The miſery of a ſoule out of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:45715:188"/> joint, and of a conſcience wounded, farre exceeds all bodily paine, and all the skill of a bodily cure: How then ſhould wee frame and accomodate our ſelves as by praier, ſo by all other meanes, to the skill of ſuch as God hath given us to be ſpirituall fathers, and to be reſtorers of us being out of joint?</p>
               <p>Firſt, therefore (brethren) let me adviſe you ere you goe to any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.1.</note> goe to God to plant and ſet your hearts aright to receive counſell. It is ſaid, in Zachar. 5.4. that the lampes which were to bee repleniſhed with the oile dropping from the olive branches by Gods providence, were ſituated ſo aptly under the dropping bowes, that none of the oile dropped beſide, but all fell upon the lamps underneath &amp; fed their lights. So would the Lord have all who goe for advice to his Interpreters; hee would have them carry hearts well planted, wiſe and tractable to receive what is put into them.</p>
               <p>Perhaps ſome may wonder at that I ſay, conſidering how hard it is for a ſad and diſtempered ſpirit to come with moulds ready to receive the molten mettall of Gods promiſes to bee faſhioned and formed thereby: But my meaning is, that whatſoever their diſtemper bee, they would ſtrive by all means for ſuch a calm, equall and teachable ſpirit, as may be ſubject to counſell when it is afforded them out of the word; otherwiſe they reſiſt the ends of the ordinance. For why hath the Lord appointed the gift of counſell ſave to ſettle and ſtabliſh the weak? The Miniſter (I doubt not) being wiſe, may both ſupply the office of liquor and veſſell alſo, counſell I meane, and an heart to receive it, if God fit him for it. But the worke will be the ſooner at an end, if all ſuch corruption as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cleaves to the diſtreſſed ſpirit be firſt removed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1. Counſell.</note>Therefore firſt, let all ſuch goe to God by praier and acquaint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with him, and him with their wants, beſeeching him who is the eternall counſellor, to order their unquiet and unſetled ſpirits, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate all carnall and worldly diſtempers, paſſions, ends and reſpects from them; to ſhew them how to picke out an end out of the ravelled skeine, and cleerly to diſcover the malady unto them: To take away all ſuch miſtakes and errors from them, as might cauſe them to miſconceive their eſtate and to thinke it other, better or worſe then it is, and to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the precious from the vile, that is, the worke of his owne convincing ſpirit, from the worke of their owne rebellious nature, their diſcontent, their fullenneſſe, melancholy, feares and other extremities that cleave unto them: Alſo that he would ſhew them what hee hath done for them already, that they may not provoke him by unthankefulneſſe, and what is yet to be done, and at what eſpeciall knots and objections they ſticke, what their chiefe barres and lets are which moſt hold them downe; and if they cannot feele themſelves rid of theſe confuſions of ſpirit, yet that the Lord would take away that wilfulneſſe of ſtomacke, that croſſeneſſe, that waywardneſſe, which makes their diſeaſe ſo ranckle in them, and ſend them to ſeeke advice, with a minde deſirous to ſubject it ſelfe to God and to his ordinance, and to mourne when it cannot, being held in the chaines of it owne horrors or rebellion.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, let them commend the enterpriſe in hand to God for ſucceſſe; that the Lord would bee pleaſed to diſpoſe of the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:45715:188"/> of him that is to adviſe them, that he may bee as from God unto them like <hi>Elihu;</hi> that he may diſcerne of their complaints, rectifie their errors, meet with their corruption, ſhew them their ſtate and wants, and comfort them at the heart as God allowes them: That if they cannot at the firſt finde ſtay and ſupport, yet (if they ſee but a little light at a crevis) they may be glad of a little and not be diſmaid; that they may ſeeke ſtill after counſell, till the worke by degrees be perfected: that they may not lay ſtumbling blocks in their owne way to fall by; but hold the meaſure of light (ſo farre as they are come) waiting till God reveale the reſt, and not defiling their conſciences the whiles,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.15.</note> and ſo make the worke new to beginne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the Miniſter of God may be wiſe as an Angell of God, as well to find out apt and meete Scriptures to encounter the ſoule, (as the need thereof requireth) either threats, or promiſes, or other ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and when they ſee that theſe are urged not by the authority of a man, but of God, (whom they only muſt look at in this caſe and not man) that then their baſe hearts may no further kick, cavill and gaineſay, and ſo put the Miniſter of God to a double toile, not only to conflict with their reall diſtreſſe, but alſo with their wilfull and accidentall ſullenneſſe, pride and rebellion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let them crave of God a wiſe utterance of their eſtate to the Miniſter of God or at leaſt an inckling thereof, that it may not be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; for a crooked rule being put into a mans hand, will force him to make a wrong line, though his skill be good enough to draw a right one.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, chuſe thee out a faithfull interpreter, one of a thouſand, for love, lenity, skill, patience, long ſuffering, bowells of compaſſion and experience: For ſuch a mercury is not made of every blocke; thou maiſt elſe light on miſerable comforters.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, above all other things, let ſuch perſons beware of any baſe motive or principle, leading them to aske advice; let them not affect any ſiniſter reſpects, nor aime at any baſe ends; to bee noted for zeale, to thinke themſelves ſafe, becauſe they have taken counſell, to choake and ſmother the accuſations of conſcience, to make them bolder in ſin, to pretend and alledge the counſell and comfort of ſuch a Miniſter, to harden themſelves againſt any juſt reproofes which after may bee urged upon them, and the like baſe ends, whereof the bouget of mans vile heart is fraught and full, eſpecially in this formall crafty age, wherein every one will be Religious, and Satan transformeth himſelfe into an Angell of light. For by this meanes that uncleane ſpirit will returne with ſeven worſe then himſelfe and defile more dangerouſly: But let thy aimes in this worke be honeſt, ſimple and ſincere, to goe forward with God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy light cheerfully and humbly, and ſo looke to proſper.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the Miniſter of God; let him be exhorted alſo, firſt,<note place="margin">2. Branch to Miniſters. 3. Things. Abhorre er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice. 1. Error.</note> to caſt out all bad principles perverting the ſpirit of counſell, and croſſing the gift of reſtoring the weake. And theſe are firſt, a prejudicate ſowre heart enclined to ſiniſter thoughts of the afflicted; conceiving them according to carnall reaſon, and not diſcerning the worke of Gods ſpirit in ſuch. This is no common grace to have a cleere ſpirit this way. For the ſpirit that is in us luſts after envy. We are all a kinne to old <hi>Eli,</hi> who
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:45715:189"/> ſeeing poore <hi>Hanna</hi> ſitting ſad, with her lippes moving and no voice, thought her drunke: But when he perceived her to bee a woman of a troubled ſpirit,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.13.14.</note> powring out her ſoule from a full heart to the Lord, and underſtanding the cauſe, he became a Prophet of God unto her, for her ſatisfaction and comfort.<note place="margin">2. Error. 3. Error.</note> Beware therefore of a baſe heart of prejudice, error, miſpriſion, raſhneſſe. (And yet take heed alſo that love and pitty, make us not too haſty in comfort.) Alſo eaſe, unmercifulneſſe, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teamingneſſe, ſullenneſſe, uncharitableneſſe, wearineſſe, and loathneſſe to be enlarged in our bowells, as the Lord allowes us, of which diſeaſe <hi>Ionah</hi> was ſicke.<note place="margin">4. Error.</note> Alſo waſpiſhneſſe, ſuddenneſſe and haſtineſſe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as Phyſitians cutting off their patients in their complaints they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to heare, and ſo diſcourage them. I confeſſe that the talkatives and vanity of many weake ones in their complaints, (who in ſtead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining their eare and hearing, that their ſoules might live are ſwifter to jangle, &amp; to neglect that which which is ſpoken, then to marke) and have never done with idle repetitions, may ſometimes cauſe a wiſe counſellor to chide and reprove them juſtly, yet with tenderneſſe and meekeneſſe. And the like I may ſay of thoſe endleſſe anſwers which many make, when they are demanded how counſell hath prevailed, and they rather bewray themſelves worſe and worſe, then better and better; for though it be not in our power to ſettle the ſpirit ſooner then the Lord pleaſe, yet it behoves not any diſtreſſed ſoule ſo to nouriſh themſelves in their low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and diſtempers, as to diſmay the Miniſter; but rather by wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealement or deſire of new ſatisfaction to draw his heart to pray for them more earneſtly, and waite more patiently till the ſpirit ſhall blow peace upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond duty. Practiſe.</note>This preparation being made, the next exhortation is, that the Miniſter of God do firſt meekly, &amp; then wiſely, ſpeak to the heart of the afflicted. For the firſt of theſe, it is a duty much preſſed and exemplified in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: I ſay a mercifull and loving heart of fellow feeling and tenderneſſe to the heavy: Fot hereby the Miniſter of God conveieth the heart of the Lord Jeſus into the ſoul of the afflicted; of whom it is ſaid, He had learned compaſſion towards them by his owne ſufferings,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.18.</note> that ſo he might pitty and ſuccour thoſe who are tempted: And ſurely wonderfull uſe there is of this grace. For alas! in theſe troubles many a poore ſoule (though not wilfull, yet) is not her owne becauſe it is overpowred with the violence, hideouſneſſe, and irkeſome of temptations without, feares and unſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned horrors within, ſo that for the time, it hath no power of faſtning upon counſell be it never ſo ſtrong, nay the ſtronger it is, the harder to enter. It muſt be time and ſtanching the bloud and waiting by degrees, putting in here a droppe, a line, a little and there a little into the ſoule, which muſt winne ſuch an one to ſome hope by degrees. Some texts obſerve for this. <hi>Elihu</hi> ſeeing <hi>Iobs</hi> ſtate ſore ſnarled by his prejudicate friends and by the ſelf-love of his own heart, &amp; that it was hard to reduce all to a mediocrity, applies himſelfe in the ſpirit of ſingular modeſty and meekneſſe to be a mediator between them:<note place="margin">Job 32.</note> Behold, ſaith he, I will not deale harſhly in miſjudging thee, but be unto thee as thine owne ſoule, this was the next way to redreſſe his ſorrowes. So <hi>Paul</hi> to the Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, when he had ſharpely reproved them, yet ſeeing many of their
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:45715:189"/> weake mindes entangled, tells them, My little children of whom I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell againe, till Jeſus Chriſt be formed in you: They had fallen into the hands of falſe teachers, who had made their ſtate more dangerous:<note place="margin">Gal. 4.19.</note> And what doth hee? Meekely and lovingly he beſtowes the paines to travell againe of them:<note place="margin">Simil.</note> A woman hath enough of breeding her fruit once and bearing it once; but wee ſhould count her a very tender mother which ſhould beare the paine twice, and fellow-feele the infants ſtrivings and wraſtlings the ſecond time, rather then want her child. So <hi>Paul</hi> here is content to beare the paine twice of travelling for theſe Galathians, (hee meanes not a ſecond birth, but a ſecond travell to reduce them home to Chriſt from their errors) and to ſympathize them ſo far for their good, till they felt Chriſt againe revived in themſelves, after a former miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and falſe conception.</p>
               <p>So in Gal. 6.1. The Apoſtle againe, doth require thoſe Galathians which were ſtrong, to reſtore in the ſpirit of meekeneſſe ſuch as were fallen, the word is ſet in joint: Be meeke and worke in the bone with much oile, that ſo it may returne againe into the ſocket with leſſe paine. And <hi>Ezekiel</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Ezek. 34.16.</note> that this is one peculi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe and the like places ſhew, with what ſpirit the Lord wiſhes ſuch to go to work, &amp; even ſo be it with us in Gods fear, limpe with the halting, liſpe with the ſtuttering, ſit ſtill and be ſilent a while, till deepe affliction can ſpeake out, helpe forth the words of the diſtreſſed which ſticke in the paſſage, be tender, and pitifull, till God draw the heart by theſe cords of a man;<note place="margin">Hoſea 11.4.13.2.</note> and be as the Maſter of the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell who taketh off the yoke and layeth meat unto them, yea as the Lord Jeſus, who would not breake the bruſed reed,<note place="margin">Matth. 12.</note> nor quench the ſmoking flax, till judgement brake forth into victory.

Now here the maine worke lieth. But ſome may aske and ſay, how ſhould I performe this duty? I anſwer, The variety and difference of eſtates, admit no rules in generall; onely to ſatisfie the deſirous, I will inſtance in a few kindes and ſhew what remedies moſt fitly agree with them.</p>
               <p>Obſerve wiſely and diſcerne the eſtate of the afflicted,<note place="margin">Rules for this.</note> and that will be a great helpe to tell a qualified counſellor how to judge both of the malady and medicine. For as it is in bodily diſeaſes, each one hath his ſeverall ſymptomes which are not eaſily concealed: So it is here. A wiſe man will diſcover the ſore by the behaviour of the party, both for the kinde, the meaſure, the continuance of it, and accordingly apply himſelfe.</p>

If theſe motives ſcatter the carnall ſorrow; and the ſpirituall remaine, then it is from God: And then the counſell is, ſtrive not to remove it at firſt, but to ground it well upon the word, that it may ſeaze kindely, and ſo deale with it according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in the rules following.</p>

Many a wretch (and theſe dayes are full of ſuch) will roare and cry out of himſelfe, the horribleneſſe of his ſins, their returns upon him after intermiſſion, not from any true abhorring of the evill of them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God dogs his curſed heart, (delighting in thoſe evills) with ſhrewd
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:45715:190"/> terrors, which although they are two extremities, I meane great ſwinge and ſweetneſſe in ſinne, and great horrors for ſinne; yet nothing hinders why both may not be at once, and yet the mediocrity farre off. In ſuch a caſe, to beleeve ſuch a wretch for his outcries and horrors when it is manifeſt, he doth but ſeeke for hope, and ſodering, and poſſibility of pardon that hee may returne to his vomit the more boldly, were to adde oile to the flame. The marke of ſuch is this, their object is that which preſently pinches them; you ſhall heare little or no aime at Chriſt and his ſweetneſſe, for they regard it not: The counſell is, to hold them hard to the law, that their ſoules may bee under bondage of ſinne as ſinne, and not onely under preſent accuſation. If this prevaile not, they will ruſh themſelves quickly out of their horrors into prophaneneſſe more and more. And had not comfort beene well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon ſuch as need none?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, though thou perceive the ſoule to bee under bondage,<note place="margin">5. Rule. Conſider whether the frame of the heart under conviction, be tame or rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious.</note> yet conſider well of what frame the party is: If the heart bee rebellious and that ſinne doth wax more ſinfull by that conviction; then (though it bee a good ſigne for time to come) yet the Lord makes no haſte to comfort ſuch a one, till his rebellion bee brought downe; and then his heart will be doubly humbled both for guilt and rebellion alſo: It is meete that ſome ſhould lie and wait under their legall abaſings, becauſe elſe, commonly they returne to their old byas againe, if they come not to ſee how out of meaſure ſinfull ſinne is in her nature. I obſerve it in this age of ours, that the law troubles few, except ſome violent croſſes attend it, which argues that they will hardly hold humble when their troubles ceaſe. Be not too haſty therefore.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, when thou ſeeſt it a ſeaſon to ſpeak a word to a poore ſoule,<note place="margin">6. Rule. Obſerve due ſeaſon.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it not: For there may be as great perill in delay, as in raſh haſte: And ſhew thy ſelfe as carefull and cordiall in preſſing of a promiſe earneſtly and effectually to a ſoule in caſe to receive it, as thou wert backward in applying it till it was ſo: A loaden ſoul is under the condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and therefore to delay ſuch an one from it is to defraud it of her portion due to it, which is a worſe ſinne then raſhneſſe, even as deſpaire is worſe then preſumption. To this end, bee converſant with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and be able to apply variety of them not knowing which may prevaile.</p>
               <p>If the affliction bee an holding downe of the ſoule from beleeving,<note place="margin">7. Rule.

For inſtance, if the ſoule be toſſed too and fro between the condition and the performance, labour to ſettle the heart upon the condition firſt, proving it truly loaden, and hold it there, telling it that the Lord is willing that it hold that which it hath gotten, and then it ſhall be more eaſie to finiſh the other worke. If the glaſſe bee ſhaken who ſhall ſee his owne face rightly? So againe, if the feare be that it hath not the conditions of the Goſpel, or hath them not in ſuch a meaſure as it ought; reſolve ſuch a one that the Lord having wrought a true loading in the ſoule, will alſo worke the ſame to the ſight of eaſe by the promiſe; which promiſe as it appeares more and more reall, both in the meriter and the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:45715:191"/> offerer; ſo it muſt needs afford more hope, more deſires, mournings and longings after it: As for the meaſure of theſe, God ſnares no poore ſoule with them: Be it never ſo feeble and bruſed, hee will not breake it. So againe, if the trouble be, that it hath long waited and is weary; that the heart is exceeding hard, corruption very ſtrong, others are got before us, we are afraid we be not elected wiih a hundred more, apply the remedy thereafter: And whereas the maine ſtoppe is Selfe, and aiming at our owne ends, and a dead heart to beleeve, let the counſell be thereafter: Subdue the baſe heart under meer mercy, enlarge the glory of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſer, above the gaine of the beleeve: Alſo bee well exerciſed in the thorow opening and urging of a promiſe on Gods part, by enlarging the length and depth, of the free, full and faithfull heart of God, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above that which a ſoule can long after.

<pb n="343" facs="tcp:45715:191"/> to ſupport us: That the wicked have prolonged their malice and the righteous have periſhed in their innocency, and yet the whiles God hath beene moſt righteous. And ſo much for a draught of theſe inſtances; according to which, others (which are innumerable) may be conceived. And therefore to finiſh the uſe, let the Miniſter of God wiſely apply himſelfe to this worke, as knowing it to be moſt pretious, neceſſary and honourable; unto the which not onely is annexed ſpeciall encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here, but alſo hereafter: Here a ſavoury report, and the loines of many poore ſoules bleſſing God for us; herereafter bleſſedneſſe it ſelfe and ſhining in glory, and that ſo much the more brightly, by how much we have converted many, as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeakes: And as for the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of it, the Lord is able to make it ſweete and eaſie by cuſtome and experience, to ſuch as deſire to bee faithfull. And ſo much for this ſecond qualification of theſe ſervants, to wit, their milde and wiſe carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to their Maſter in this his diſtempered condition.</p>
               <p>Now according to my former method, I proceed from the perſons at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting, to the attempt it ſelfe. Wherein I conſidered in the ſervants a ſecret taxation of their Maſter, which I call ſo, becauſe it lyes onely couched and conveied cloſely, (as became inferiours) in the manner of utterance, for it is an expoſtulatory queſtion, intimating their diſlike of the diſtemper which he was in, and that Selfe and carnall reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was carried againſt the Prophet: As if they had in plaine tearmes ſaid Maſter, this thy deſcanting againſt the Prophet, by thy cavills and carnall reaſon, is not comely for a man in thy caſe: If the Prophet had ſaid ſome great thing, thou ſeemedſt forward to obey, why then doſt thou ſo cavill and contradict him in this his meſſage?</p>

Touching this point of carnall reaſon, I have ſaid much of it already, here I repeat nothing: If the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the doctrine will adde any other things worth obſervation, I will onely inſiſt thereupon, and that very ſhortly to ſhunne tediouſneſſe.

Or ſhall all the fiſh of the ſea bee gathered together for them? What doth the Lord anſwer? Doth he put up this carnall ſpeech?

Another Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture like it,<note place="margin">Numb. 20.10.11.</note> is that where the people murmured for water not at Rephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dim, Exod. 17. but at Kadeſh; whereupon the Lord commanding <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to ſatisfie them by ſmiting the rocke: But they in an indignation at their baſeneſſe, outſhot them in their owne carnall reaſon, ſaying, come onye rebells, hath God nothing to do, ſave to give you water out of the rocke?

Yes, in due ſeaſon, but not then when the Lord was working a miracle among them: Therefore together with a checke hee incloſes them with thoſe rebells, both in the marke of their ſinne, calling the place Maſſa and Meriba for their cavilling with the people, as he called that of Rephidim by the like name for their murmuring againſt God: And as he told the rebells that all their carcaſſes ſhould fall in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo he told them that they ſhould dye there too. A ſad penalty, and reall reproofe of their carnality.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">John 6.42.</note>Another place is that of our Saviour, to thoſe Jewes who following him for the loaves, were by him perſwaded to behold himſelfe the true bread and manna and water of life: This ſeemed to their groſſe carnall ſenſe ſenſleſſe, and therefore they aske, how ſhall he give us his fleſh to eat? Our Saviour anſwers, Murmure not within your ſelves; you doe not well, you are but carnall in thus ſpeaking, for you can doe no other then as you are; till my father teach you wiſdome, it is not your reaſon can compaſſe my matters, you were as good hold your tongues as patter about them: So when <hi>Martha,</hi> (who yet before had ſaid that ſhee knew Chriſt could doe all things) yet ſeeing the ſtone to be rolled away,<note place="margin">Iohn 11.22.39.</note> where <hi>Lazarus</hi> her brother was laid, cryes out, Lord by this time he ſtincketh, hee hath beene buried foure daies; but her carnality and contrariety ſo ſtancke in Chriſts noſtrills, that he is faine to checke her, even before he did the miracle; Said not I unto thee, if thou wouldeſt beleeve, thou ſhouldeſt ſee the glory of God; as if he had ſaid, why doſt thou ſo croſſe me in this my attempt? Were it not juſt to deprive thee of the miracle, ſeeing thou preferreſt thy ſenſe before my power? So <hi>Peter,</hi> when hee being bidden to come to Chriſt on the water,<note place="margin">Matth. 14.35.</note> attempted to come, and by the way funke, (through carnall ſenſe, which told him that the waters were not things to goe upon, but the firme earth;) what ſaith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to him? Oh thou of little faith! Is it not all one for my power to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thee upon the waters as upon the dry land? Why didſt thou ſtagger from my word? And many more might be heapt up to this purpoſe, all to convince, that although we might thinke it veniall for weake fleſh to cleave to her owne carnall conceits, becauſe Gods matters exceed her much; yet God having once teſtified his pleaſure by his word, lookes that fleſh lay hold upon her mouth, ſtoope to the Lord, and when it doth not, he may juſtly rebuke her. As <hi>Sarah</hi> for her laughing was checked, and <hi>Zachariah</hi> for his diſtruſt,<note place="margin">Luke 1.20.</note> was not onely ſo, but ſtricken dumbe for three quarters of a yeares ſpace, and all to teach them to preferre the word before their owne ſenſe: So that even as <hi>Paul</hi> ſeeing <hi>Elymas</hi> to croſſe his Miniſtery,<note place="margin">Act. 13.10.</note> and to harden <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> in his infidelity, ſets himſelfe tooth and naile againſt him, and looked ſtedfaſtly upon him, ſaying, Oh! thou full of all ſubtilty and miſchiefe, ſonne of the Divell, wilt thou not ceaſe perverting the wayes of the Lord? Even ſo, the Lord ſeeing this ſorcereſſe of carnall reaſon ſtanding at the elbow of the ſoule, to diſſwade and hold it off from beleeving, doth with indignation
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:45715:192"/> cut her up and ſay, Oh thou full of all venome and poyſon, dareſt thou thus pervert the truth and faithfulneſſe of the promiſe? And our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did the like to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> caviling againſt the myſtery of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Baptiſme, what (ſaith he) Art thou a great Doctor in Iſrael,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.5.</note> and yet ſuch a dunce and ideot in the matters of God? What a ſhame, and (as it were) a box on the eare was this, for ſuch a Rabbi? And although he ſeemed to deale ſomewhat more fairely with <hi>Thomas</hi> in his refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtoutneſſe of carnall reaſon, Except I ſee the print of the ſpeare in his ſides, and nailes in his hands, I will not beleeve; yet we ſhall ſee hee gave him a ſhrewd touch upon that mercifull conviction: Be faithfull (ſaith he) not incredulous: Bleſſed are they that ſee not and yet beleeve:<note place="margin">Joh. 21.</note> I tell thee, it is ſmall thanke to thee to beleeve having ſeene.

               <p>Reaſons of the point are many. Firſt this, It is the chiefe marke of all <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> other in Gods eye, and a duty of the greateſt import, when the ſoule breaking through the miſty aire, and foggy clouds which doe beſet the clearesky, even as carnall reaſon overwhelmes the cleere promiſe; ſhall pierce and behold the word in her brightneſſe and true colours: Oh! how it ſpeakes to the heart of God, to be truſted upon his bare word; when the ſoule makes a tuſh of carnall objections, and ſaith, the word is againſt it: Examples we have of this alſo in Scripture: See Numb. 14.5. where the ten ſpies bringing a verduict of ſenſe (by the terror of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kims, and chariots of iron) to their brethren, and diſmaying their hearts from going to Canaan: Lo, thoſe two worthies <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the word, made a tuſh at the other objections; If the Lord love us (ſay they) he will bring us into this land, as for theſe Giants, they ſhall be but meat for us: What are they to a word of an omnipotent God? What came of it? Surely the Lord tooke it ſo kindly, as he ſcarce knew how to expreſſe it; twice or thrice after he tells <hi>Moſes, Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua</hi> have honoured me before this people, and borne downe their wretched partners: Therefore of all the reſt (who ſhall leave their bones in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe) theſe two ſhall inherit this good land. So <hi>David,</hi> when all the body of the people were ſcared and ranne from the Philiſtin, onely cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, why? Who is this uncircumciſed Philiſtin? what make yee of him? I make but a dead dog of him, a railer upon God and his hoaſt:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 17.</note> And what came of it? God encloſed him (by his faith) into his hands, and as Heb. 11.34. he was made ſtrong of weake, and put to flight an Army by that meanes. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, Act. 27. when all were againſt him, both <hi>Pilate,</hi> Centurion and Souldiers, they all thought that there was no way for them but to periſh; contrary to their feares, <hi>Paul</hi> is confident, that not an haire of their head ſhould fall to the ground. For why? Saith he, although I ſee as much againſt it in ſhew as you doe, yet an Angel of God ſtood by me this night and told me ſo, and I beleeve God: Oh! how did the Lord honour him with the ſafety of all in the ſhip?</p>
               <p>Now to conclude, if the Lords heart be ſo ſet upon beleevers: How muſt he needs caſt a ſad countenance upon them that overthrow his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and will beleeve no more then they ſee? Contrary objects to thoſe which are moſt deſireable, muſt needs be moſt unwelcome? And
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:45715:193"/> if the one provoke eſteeme, how can it chuſe, but the other muſt cauſe indignation?</p>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>2</label> Secondly, it muſt be needs a very reproveable evill which cauſeth ſuch a fulſomeneſſe and weariſomeneſſe in Gods ſtomacke: Now wee ſhall note it in the Scripture, how loathingly God ſpeakes of carnality, and a ſenſuall ſpirit in his matters. See Pſal. 92. The Lord tells us, that he led the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe as ſhepherds lead their ſheepe,<note place="margin">Eſay 63.</note> and all that they might ſee his workes and know him, and truſt him the better: But (ſaith he) forty yeares long have I beene vexed with this generation; They have tempted me, proved me, and wearied me: Therefore I ſware in my wrath, they ſhould not enter into my reſt. Why? Becauſe all his miracles and deeds before their eyes, could not draw them to truſt him, but (as if heathens) they would cleave ſtill to their fleſhly reaſon. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he that ſweares in his wrath to deſtroy, and is vexed with people, hee doth more then reprove. This for the ſecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, for our ſelves, how can it bee in us but a moſt damnable ſinne much more reproveable? For as it reſiſts the whole method of God through the whole world, ſo it ſinnes againſt almoſt every Chapter and line of the old and new Teſtament: For tell me, why hath God ſo furniſhed his word with ſuch ſtories of his power and greatneſſe, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending our reaſon and our thoughts, as much as the heavens doe the earth,<note place="margin">Eſay. 55.8.</note> but that our ſoules might be filled with his excellency? And thinke nothing too hard for ſuch a God to doe: If he have dried up the ſea Jorden, ſtopped mouthes of Lions, raiſed up the dead, and fed ſix hundred thouſand men and women without corne or fleſh of beaſts, made water guſh twice out of a rocke, give a woman of ninety years old power to conceive, &amp;c. doth he not deſerve to be ſet up above car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reaſon? Doth he not deſerve at our hands more then a faint fulſome grant with <hi>Martha,</hi> thou canſt doe all things? Doth he not deſerve a peculiar faith for this and for that, for raiſing this dead man now at this time? For quickning this dead heart at this inſtant by this Sermon? For ſoftning this hard heart? For converting this ſoule to God? Oh! how juſtly reproveable muſt ſuch a villany needs bee! And ſurely, this let me adde, if it be ſo baſe an evill in reſpect of the diſhonour to God, muſt it needs bee ſo in reſpect of the miſchiefe which it cauſes unto our ſelves? Did ever any man hate his owne ſelfe? doth he not love and cheriſh his owne fleſh? What an unnaturall evill then is this, which chuſeth rather here with <hi>Naaman</hi> to periſh with the holding of a carnall will and conceit, then by denying it and claſping to the word, to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for ever? Sure that which is ſo derogatory to God, and ſo unnaturall to our ſelves, muſt needs deſerve ſharpe reproofe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it muſt needs be a reproveable evill, which doth ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>4</label> trench upon all the Attributes of God, Power, Truth, Mercy, Juſtice, Providence and Alſufficiency: Which queſtions all, cavills a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all, ſo that the doctrine before handled, <hi>viz.</hi> That carnall reaſon is a maine enemy to all the matters of revealed truths, is a full reaſon of this doctrine, that it is juſtly reproveable: Other ſinnes ſeeme to undoe the acts of God as his morall commands: But this undoes the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, (in a ſort) in thoſe things wherein God is himſelfe; ſo that either
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:45715:193"/> God muſt not be God, a promiſe muſt not be a promiſe, Chriſt muſt be no Chriſt, no ſatisfaction, no redemption, or elſe carnall ſenſe muſt periſh: Both in ſtrict tearmes cannot ſtand together: God hath teſtified himſelfe in his word, admirable in this one attribute, <hi>viz.</hi> Providence for his Churches good in the greateſt ſtraits: Who reading the ſtrange paſſages of that one deliverance in <hi>Eſters</hi> time,<note place="margin">Eſters ſtory.</note> how God concurred juſt with each circumſtance of time, of occaſion, as then to cauſe the Kings ſleepe to depart when <hi>Mordecai</hi> was in greateſt perill and reproach? Then when the banquet was prepared, that all other opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhould bee fore laid to oppreſſe <hi>Haman,</hi> and to exalt <hi>Mordecai?</hi> If a man would compile a ſtory according to his owne wiſh for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of Providence, could hee frame a more punctuall one? Read <hi>Ezra's</hi> ſtory, <hi>Daniels, Ioſephs,</hi> doth not a naked hand of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in them? And yet carnall reaſon would ſay, That if there were windowes in heaven, God could not now ſave his Church, as hee hath done in their times, in <hi>Elija's, Eliſha's</hi> and others. What is this but to limit the holy one of Iſrael to our owne meaſure of working? And ſo I may ſay of all other his Attributes. Nay carnall reaſon is ſuch a deepe gulfe as is able to ſwallow downe the greateſt evidence that ever God gave to the world of himſelfe, both his Godhead and Attributes which is the ſending of the Lord Jeſus in the fleſh into the world, to walke, live, ſuffer and dye for the ſalvation of the Elect: What can ſo ſecure the ſoule of the truth of Gods nature, perſons and realneſſe in all his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as this, to cauſe the eternall God to be perſonally one with our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall fleſh? Might not the holy Ghoſt Heb. 1.1.2. ſay, That this way of God hath greater demonſtration in it to ſtabliſh a beleeving ſoule then all that ever were beſides? And yet what uſe makes carnall reaſon hereof? Doth it not turne all to a meere ſtory without any ground-worke of faith or perſwaſion? We thinke that the exhibiting of Chriſt concerned the Jewes who ſaw him, and if wee had lived with him as they, we ſhould have abhorred to diſtruſt him as they: Why? Did not God give them full aſſurance of himſelfe by his Sonne? Read Act. 17.38. Had not they as cleere proofes out of the Prophets, that he was, and none ſave he, could bee the Meſſia? and yet their carnall reaſon did ſo abhorre him to be their Meſſia, that they hated him to the death. Juſtly then may I conclude, that this ſinne is a reproveable one. So much alſo for reaſons.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to the Uſe: If this evill be ſo reproveable, it is pitty it <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> ſhould want her due, and eſcape terror or reproofe:<note place="margin">Terror to ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry. The firſt.

Let them therefore come in the dint of this reproofe who are groſſeſt in this kinde, Neuters and Atheiſts, who if they do not obſtinate their ſpirits to thinke of all Gods matters and the frame of Religion according to their carnall ſence, yet are as deeply care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of rejecting and bearing it down by the ſtream of the word, as <hi>Gallio</hi> was careleſſe of the Apoſtles and their oppoſites: How many are there who like them in <hi>Peter,</hi> mocke at the Scriptures, threats and terrors of it,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.</note> ſaying, Where is the promiſe of his comming? Lo all things are ſtill as they were wont to be, the times, ſeaſons, affaires of men and courſe of the world; therefore wee thinke the world will endure alway: Oh
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:45715:194"/> ye Atheiſts! One yeare with God, is as a thouſand, and a thouſand are as one day: Do ye judge the comming of Chriſt by that which befalls in the ſpace of forty or fifty yeares of one mortall life? Doe not all things decay, and cannot the Lord ſhake the powers of heaven, and reſtraine the influence of the upper bodies from the lower at his pleaſure? But of this (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) they make themſelves wilfully ignorant, that all things were made of nothing and ſhall returne to nothing; they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves that they ever were and ſo ſhall continue: Such a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary there is and ſuch a tale of ſcurfe here among us, even of practicke Atheiſts, who are led by ſenſe as brute beaſts, that me thinkes I feele my ſpirit ſinke and faile within me, when I ſhould ſcare them out of their dens: Theſe are thoſe prophane Swine, who although they riſe not up openly to deſie God and his word and threats, yet like ſenſuall Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures void of all underſtanding, they live in a profeſſion of infidelity, (onely differing from Pagans, in that they carry the badge of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection about them for faſhion ſake) but elſe reſolved to ſuffer no word of truth to enter into them or trouble them, and make a privy contract with Satan to hold their owne luſts, againſt all Preaching, what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is there betweene thinking there is no God, and reſiſting him ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in his word? Betweene open maintaining that there is no judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, reſurrection or torment for ſinners, and the practice of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſwearings, breaking of Sabbaths, ſtealth, adultery, and all debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedneſſe?</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay unto you?

Howſter out ſuch vermine (O ye Church offcers, if ye ſerve for oughts) out of their ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells!

Alas! the Divell is ſerved as well by ſuch, as by them that have read Lectures of Atheiſme heretofore! They profeſſe a God you will ſay;<note place="margin">Tit. 1. ult.</note> what is that, when they are in their workes abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and to each good thing reprobate? They live by ſwiniſh prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and cuſtomes of darkeneſſe, they ſee all ſwayed by mony, favour and pollicy; they ſee others all for backe and belly, purſe and pleaſures, pompe and preferments, and therefore further they will not ſtir. They whom carnall reaſon meerly rules, are negative Atheiſts, becauſe they admit of no principles which ſhould make them other, and cauſe them to tremble at themſelves! Oh! mourne (deare brethren) for this, that the Land ſwarmes with ſuch, and pray for ſuch as are in place, that they may reforme it, and conſider with what fruit we requite God for this ſeventy yeares of his Goſpel paſt, by nouzeling up among us a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that know no more of ſinne, Chriſt, judgement day, then the ſwine at the trough, but rather trample upon theſe pearles! Tell them of their waſhing, brewing, baking, ſtartching on the Sabbath, and they anſwer, Alas! we are poore, and the ſix daies are little enough to worke in and earne meate to our bellies! we muſt be fed and cloathed, and more then we worke, we muſt looke for nothing! Others being asked about their
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:45715:194"/> hope in death, tell us, they have had their purgatory here in want and miſery, and therefore hope they ſhall have no more hereafter! Others live by a Popiſh mixture of ſome ſhreads with their owne wiſdome, and ſuch errors of the wicked as they ſuck up every where: The iſſue of all is, they abhorre the word and thoſe that live by it, and doe wholly breath in the element of their owne carnall ſavour! Oh woefull ones! your damnation ſleepes not, and the flood of Gods wrath, the fire of vengeance ſhall ſweepe you to hell,<note place="margin">Matth. 24.38.</note> as the waters did them who ate and dranke, married and gave in marriage, and would know nothing till they were under water!

But what, hath this long ſuffering of God led them to repentance? Hath not their clay laid in the warme ſunne, hardened the more?

Yet hath the Lord blowne over our fears, made a calme, ſwallowed up death into vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory? Nay, ſome of us in our deepeſt ſickneſſes of body, (when ſinne and Satan are moſt buſie) have we not found God neerer to us, then in our beſt health? Hath he not anſwered us as <hi>Hanna</hi> in our long praiers? Hath he not enlarged the promiſe unto us by the ſeale of his Spirit, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (as I may ſay) the light of the Moone, as the light of the Sunne, and the light of the Sunne ſeven times greater then ever, in comfort and holy confidence above all feares? How hath this wrought with us? Hath it knit us in ſo firm a covenant with God as never to be broken off? Hath it cauſed us to walke here below as ſhadowes, and to deſpiſe all the earth in compariſon of our hopes? I doubt not but ſome doe, and ſhall finde the fruit of it at death.</p>
               <p>But oh! that ſuch faire wether ſhould doe harme, and be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to make us wax wanton, earthly, and thinke grace to be pind to our ſleeves, how reproveable is it? Good brethren, looke to your ſelves: If carnall reaſon bee ſo baſe, what is it to blindfold our eies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ocular mercies? Oh! ſuch favours as ſome of us have met with, ſhould make us cry out, I have found, I have found! God hath not dealt with others as with me! Therefore whether it be my lot to be in ſtraits, or whatſoever temptations, I muſt endure, yet I will call to minde the old mercies of the Lord and be comforted; yea I will gladly be under infirmity,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.9.</note> that the ſtrength of God may be perfected in me; and though he kill me, yet I will truſt in him through mercy!

Who would have thought that when <hi>Hezechias</hi> requeſt was granted, to wit, the going backe of the Sunne tenne degrees for the aſſuring of his recovery, that his recovery ſhould have beene ſo ſtained with apoſtacy? But alas! God hath made our fears and griefes goe back as many for us, and yet we have revolted, not as he did once, but made a falling ſickneſſe of our courſe!</p>
               <p>To conclude the Uſe: In the Sacraments and Seales of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sort. </seg>8</label> how hath Chriſt come (as it were) in his likeneſſe unto us, and by outward ſignes ſpoken to all our ſenſes, yea thruſt our hands into his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſides, that if it be not himſelfe, let us diſtruſt him ſtill; ſee, feele, ſmell, handle, taſte, eate my fleſh, drinke my bloud: a fancy hath no ſubſtance; lo here is ſubſtance: What fruit hath it had? Brethren, I ſhall ſpeake a fearfull ſpeech, I am reſolved that the carnall reaſon of moſt men is enlarged, rather then diminiſhed by the Sacraments: And the judgement of moſt is become greater by them, then if they had never had any!

                  <note place="margin">Inſtances. 1. Putters off the promiſe to be reproved.</note>Firſt, I ſay this may bee a pranke of an hollow heart, and then it is horrible: As we ſee in thoſe Jewes, who were alway preſſing upon Chriſt for a ſigne: Tell us if thou be the Chriſt? And why? Not as meaning to beleeve, (for ſo he tells them.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Inſtan. </seg>2</label> Another Inſtance is this: Beloved, ſo long as Gods government in the Church,<note place="margin">Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God muſt not be quarrelled.</note> or upon our ſelves pleaſes us, while hee dandles us in his lap, holds off enemies, enlarges our abilities, keepes under our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, tries us by no great temptations, annoints our paths for us, and gives us better gifts, fruit of our labours and outward bleſſings, then we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: Oh how we can cleave to him! This drawes water out of a marble ſtone! But let our ſunne enter never ſo little into an eclipſe, or if God remove our ſtrong holds from us, leave us to enemies, ſeem to ſmile upon them, ſide with them, ſuffer them to enjoy whatſoever their heart could wiſh,<note place="margin">Pſal. 80.4. Job 1. Mica 2.7.</note> in having their wills on us: But to frown upon us not onely while we ſinne, but when we repent, and to diſregard us even in our moſt frequent &amp; importunate praiers: Do we then perſiſt in our uprightnes? Dowe then (as <hi>Micah</hi> ſaith) beleeve that ſtill Gods word is as good as ever it was, to ſuch as walke uprightly? When neither Moon nor Sun appears for many dayes, do we abhor to ſuffer darkeneſſe to poſſeſſe us within, becauſe there is ſuch a darkeneſſe without? Can we fall to <hi>Pauls</hi> remedy, Act. 27.20.<note place="margin">Act. 27.20. Judg. 6. Mica 7.9.10.</note> I beleeve God? No, no, wee cavill and ſay, If the Lord be with us, how are all theſe evills upon us? Why I beſeech you? Although hee hath promiſed to all beleeving ſoules to ſhew them light in darkeneſſe, and after to turne their darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe into light, yet did hee ever promiſe us to keepe this darkeneſſe quite from us? Had Chriſts love ſo appeared, if he had come and kept <hi>Lazaras</hi> from dying, as it did by raiſing him up when hee was dead and beganne to ſtinke? Bring me forth one word ſounding that way that God would alway keepe one even tenor of outward peace and proſperity over his Church, and then tell him hee is not as good as his word.</p>
               <p>But this is a Religion better fitting Papiſts (who know not what faith is) then ſuch as we! Oh be warned! This carnality of ours ſits neere Gods heart, loades him as the cart with ſheaves is loaden: Doe not
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:45715:196"/> give God over thus: ſay there will be light for the righteous, it is ſown for them, though not come up, yet God is good to Iſrael, to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in heart: The eternall ſtrength of God is a braſen pillar,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.1.</note> which the ſoul may ſwing all her ſtrength upon in the greateſt ſtraits, &amp; (although heaven and earth goe together) ſuch ſhall have peace, peace, that is ſure peace, as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaks: and as for carnall reaſon, ſhe ſhall ſee it too,<note place="margin">Eſay 26.2.3. 2 King. 7.3.</note> but ſhe ſhall not eat thereof, it is a dainty onely ſerving for waiters and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: It is faith which muſt doe the worke of workes, keepe fire from conſuming the buſh, or burning the three children: It is faith which muſt doe all theſe feats, Heb. 11.35.36.37. Carnall reaſon never wrought one miracle, but it hath marred many. Faith and the power of God hath kept a venice glaſſe from being broken againſt the wall, when it was caſt with violence: But carnall reaſon breakes all it throwes.</p>
               <p>Therefore to conclude, take heed of her, and learne admonition to lot upon the word of truth, for thy ſelfe, for the Church, in the promiſe of God, in the providence and alſufficiency of God: If he ſatisfie not thy deſires, know it is not becauſe he is weaker, or falſer, or leſſe piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then he was, but he hath other ends then thou ſeeſt, hee aimes at purging out thy canker of Selfe, and perhaps hath more univerſall ends for the manifeſting of his vengeance upon a Nation not worthy to be beloved, &amp; deſerving a decree to come forth: This is no ſeaſon for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſenſe to lowre, but for faith to fall to worke, if not to ſave others, yet to ſave each one himſelfe, and lay in (as <hi>Ioſia</hi> did) for himſelfe,<note place="margin">Jer. 45. 2 Kings 22.20.</note> that he may have his life for a prey, and he may not ſee the evills which ſhall come upon others. And ſo alſo to lay in pledges of hope for poſterity, that when Gods winter is come downe, and his people ſcoured, and his old braſſe and candleſticks melted, he will make better veſſels of our poſterities, even zealous ones, and prepared for every good worke.</p>
               <p>And againe, a third Inſtance may be this: The outward difficulty of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Inſtance. </seg>3</label> the times is great, the Lord having marveilouſly plagued our ſpirituall ſurfeting upon his bread of life, not onely with a famine of it, but even with cleanneſſe of teeth. This hath beene a ſore yeare for the poore, and pinched the rich! What doe you poore ones now? (For the rich may ſcape better:) Do ye fall to fears that you ſhall be ſtarven? Or your do ye ſolace your ſelves, that ſtill the word abides for a ſtay unto hearts in theſe hard times? Tell me truly? Doth leſſe meat ſerve you becauſe you truſt God? Doth faith and a cheerfull heart make a little goe a great way? Or doe ye runne to the curſed phraſe, If windowes were in heaven it could not be holpen: Truly I hope ſome of ye ſpeake the truth, when you ſay, Gods word (for man is not fed with bread on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) doth ſuſtaine you! It is a ſigne that fleſh and ſenſe doe not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether beare rule! I am glad it is no worſe; goe on and proſper, and as the Lord hath hitherto holpen you, ſo that the ſcarſity of other theviſh ſavage poore hath not oppreſſed you, ſo hee ſhall ſtill finde mercy in mens hearts and purſes to relieve and helpe you through this famine while plenty come; onely learne by this experience to build your al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar with <hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſay, Hitherto the Lord hath holpen us, and ſo hee will: he hath not kept us from a Beare and a Lion, that a Giant,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 7.12.</note> a Dog
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:45715:197"/> ſhould deſtroy us. Say thus, The Lord hath not yet put us ſo ſharply upon the pikes of famine, as that we ſhould eate our owne children, or mice, dogs, cats and rats, as in former ages of Popery they have done in this Kingdome: Therefore I will truſt him ſtill, and although there ſhall be no Calfe left in the ſtall,<note place="margin">Habac. 3.</note> nor Bullocke in the flocke yet the Lord ſhall be my ſalvation. I will not (as poore as I am) ſay, as a Carle lately did, of great wealth, I ſhall dye a beggar: Neither will fall to pillaging and breaking open granaries to ſerve my turne, nor riſe up againſt the rich, as lately ſome did in ſome parts of this Country, and were juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Concluſion of the Uſe.</note>Laſtly, in generall, be we armed by this doctrine and admonition, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the common ſway of the age to beleeve as we ſee: They ſay of the dampe in Colepits, that if it come, it will cauſe the candle to burne blue,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> and thereby the workemen haſte them to the mouth of the pit preſently, leſt they be choaked. This world is the Colepit, this dampe is the carnall Religion of it, the candle burning blue is the infection of mens underſtandings and wills: when therefore we ſee this infection to have tainted moſt mens hearts, and the power of goodneſſe decaying; then let us be warned, looke to our lives, ere we be choked with the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the wicked, and let us runne to the pits mouth, and deſire to bee haled up to the open aire; let us goe to the Word and Teſtimony, and as <hi>David</hi> did,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.</note> ere he was quite ſtifled, let us goe into the Sanctuary, and lay this carnall religion in the ballances of it, and we ſhall find it too light, and ſuch as is reprobate ſilver, for both weight and ſubſtance, and then we ſhall cling to a more ſure word of the Prophets and Apoſtles ſhining in a darke place,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.20.</note> which doing, we ſhall doe well, and ſo not bee reproved or rejected. So much for this third.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>4</label> Fourthly, let this be Information to all who would ſhunne this bitter reproofe of God; to bee well adviſed how they enter upon Religion, with a ſound judgement about the nature thereof. Marke and learne this, as all common thinges (for the moſt part) goe by ſenſe and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall grounds: So Gods matters goe by contraries. Logicke and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy reach not, comprehend not Gods myſteries. Religion is not againſt ſenſe or reaſon, (for then why ſhould <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. urge the Atheiſt by ſimilitudes of naturall things, to grant ſpirituall, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him of the reſurrection by naturall experience of the corne rotting ere it live? And ſo by others:) But its above it, and therefore reſiſts it; rules of art and reaſon faile here: Reaſon ſaith, of nothing comes nothing: God ſaith I create the fruit of the lips, peace, even of nothing: Yea of nothing comes every good thing. He that denies himſelfe and is nothing, ſhall be my Diſciple. Other vertues goe by addition: Gods by ſubtraction. God counts the things that are not, as if they were. The principles of Divinity are not as ſenſe is. The Lord Jeſus himſelfe truly eternall, yet truly mortall. God cannot dye, and yet they killed the Lord of life. Chriſt a very man, and no perſon, but a nature. By death to conquer death is a ſenſleſſe thing in reaſon. Fleſh conſumed to duſt, yet ſhall bee made againe the ſelfe ſame body. Reaſon attempts great things by great inſtruments. The Lord uſes the pooreſt and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt. Reaſon would ſay, the richeſt make moſt rich: Religion tells us,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:45715:197"/> As poor, and yet making many rich. As having nothing yet poſſeſſing all things. That a poore company of fiſhermen ſhould conquer the world, which <hi>Alexanders</hi> army could not. That Babes ſhould underſtand myſteries which wiſe men cannot. That the King of all the world ſhould ride upon an Aſſe, &amp;c. How abſurd are theſe notions? But to be principled in theſe ſenſleſſe truths, irrationall principles, what a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full advantage is it to a poore ſoule in her firſt entrance upon Religion? How will it prepare the heart to beare downe reaſon and fleſh? To thinke the better of truth by how much it croſſes reaſon moſt? To beare troubles and croſſes meekely, becauſe by how much leſſe they promiſe any happineſſe, by ſo much the rather they performe it? So much for this uſe of Inſtruction.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let this point bee uſe of comfort to all Gods people, who <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>5</label> cleave to the word,<note place="margin">Conſolation. Cloſe clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to Gods promiſe, are in a bleſſed ſtate.</note> or elſe ſoone recover their ſliding foote from this common error: For if carnall reaſon be ſo reproveable, then is living by faith commendable. The Lord ſhall one day cauſe thy light to breake forth poore ſoule who in all the forenamed reſpects, lookeſt more to <hi>Paul</hi> then the Pilot, to the word, then the world and her Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Thou liveſt here as a diſpiſed creature, as one of Gods fooles thruſt up into a corner, as a candleſticke throwne up and downe the houſe, who wert wont to hold out the candle to the houſe of God: Be of good cheere, if thou be content to be as God will have thee, and to teach thine owne ſoule in ſtead of teaching others, if thou be one who wilt thruſt thine eyes blindefold into Gods boſome, and ſee no further then he hath light for thee; take courage to thy ſelfe,<note place="margin">Mica 6 9. Pſal. 37.</note> one day it ſhall be better, and the Lord ſhall bring forth thy righteouſneſſe as noon day. He ſhall take thee from among the crokt pots, and reſtore thy doves ſilver wings as bright as before: waite the whiles, &amp; be doing the thing which is good. When the Lord ſhall come in flaming fire againſt all that have ſet up their creſt againſt him, and bee a ſwift witneſſe againſt them, then ſhall he refine his <hi>Levy</hi> with this fire of triall,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.3.4.

Heb. 10.37.</note> and by this day (or night rather) of tentation, which he hath ſpread over the face of the earth, if thou hold the word of his patience, he ſhall bring thee forth of the Colepit. And then ſhall hee be admired by them and in them that beleeve, becauſe (abandoning themſelves) the word was received by them in that day! I ſay, caſt not away thy confidence, it hath great recompence of reward. But what ſhould I need to comfort thee, who carrieſt the matter of comfort within thee?

Now we proceed in order to the third: <hi>viz.</hi> The arguments which they uſe to perſwade their Maſter to obey the meſſage:<note place="margin">The third ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, viz. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The firſt whereof, is the eaſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying.</note> I told you there were foure of them: I come to the firſt, &amp; that is of greateſt weight, let us note it wel. And that is, that this obeying and waſhing, was an eaſie taske. The words give it cleerly, for thus they argue, If it had been a difficult thing which the Prophet had enjoyned thee, thou wouldeſt have done it, and wilt thou not doe this which is ſo eaſie? So that now this firſt motive, they oppoſe to the chiefe ſtop and let in their Maſters thoughts, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and unlikely way to ſucceed: They tell him no, it was a very eaſie one, and likely to ſucceed: For the other reaſons I will open them as I come to them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, let us faſten upon this: And for the Text you ſee it manifeſt, the ſervants urge their Maſter with the priviledge which God by the Prophet hath beſtowed upon him: God (ſay they) of meere mercy hath ſent for thee by his Prophet, of his owne accord offered thee a cure, upon condition of waſhing: By this meanes it comes to paſſe that
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:45715:198"/> whatſoever it be to other lepers, whom God hath not vouchſafed this honour (to whom it is no eaſie worke) yet to thee it is: Looke not thou at the difficulty of the cure in it ſelfe, or to others, looke thou at the priviledge which God conferres upon thee above others, and to be ſure by vertue thereof, thy cure is eaſie. Now if it be ſo, ſtand not queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any longer why ſuch and ſuch lepers come ſhort of cure, leave that to God; (mercy onely can give a reaſon of that) but conſider that, to thee, <hi>Naaman</hi> in perſon, this grace is offered, to waſh and be cleane: Take the offer as it lyes to thee thus under Gods call, and to thee it muſt needs be as eaſie as it ſeems. Now if it be ſo, make it not worſe then God hath made it: That which God hath made eaſie, make not thou difficult: But waſh and be cleane.</p>
               <p>The point then is this, Obeying of the charge of God. To beleeve and be ſaved, is an eaſie taske. But here quickly you will object, how is this Doctrine raiſed? Did <hi>Naamans</hi> ſervants, or <hi>Naaman</hi> himſelfe, underſtand each other, or conceive the charge and promiſe, to reach at any thing ſave a meere bodily cure?</p>
               <p>What is that to the beleeving of a promiſe? The eaſe of the one, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> proves not the other eaſie.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> as before, I grant your objection to be true, in reſpect of themſelves conſidered apart: but now I conſider them both in and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the aſſiſtance of that grace, which intended <hi>Naamans</hi> converſion in all the paſſages concurring thereto: So that as the affronts and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings which <hi>Naaman</hi> had, were ordered by the Lord for a ſpirituall humbling &amp; ſelfedeniall, ſo the advice of the ſervants is guided by God to a ſpirituall iſſue, although perhaps neither of them ſaw it for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent till afterward. Who can ſay, that the words of that poore blinde man, Joh. 9.10. in the defence and honour of Chriſt, were (to his own feeling) any other, then meere thankefulneſſe and naturall affection to Chriſt for his benefit of ſight received? For as yet he had no faith; and yet it is queſtionleſſe, that on Chriſts behalfe, they were ſecret ſeeds of that eſteeme of Chriſt, and breakings off from the hopes of things below, which afterward brake out more cleerly, (when Chriſt met him) into actuall beleeving.

               <p>The reaſons may bee taken from ſundry kinds of eaſe. Firſt, from that reſpective eaſe which ſtands in relation:<note place="margin">

                     </gap>y of the Law.</note> And for that I ſay, that there is great difference between the difficult way of the Law, and the ſweet way of the Goſpel. The Law preſcribed a tedious, yea an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible way to heaven, Doe this and live, requiring ſo exact, pure and ſtrict a way, as exceeded the capacity and ability of our fallen nature to attaine: Now the Lord in the Goſpel propounds another way, moſt eaſie and comprehenſive, and that in and by another, ſaying, Beleeve and live. He changes the rigor and burdenſomeneſſe of doing, into the eaſe of beleeving, which tranſlates the guilt and curſe of the ſoule up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, tranſlates the ſervice of obedience upon another, drawes power and ability to endeavour after obeying from another, who
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:45715:199"/> alſo covers and conceales the defects thereof, and accepts ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours as proceed from a nature in great part unſanctified, as if they came from an intire and perfect principle. As imputation of a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, is a farre eaſier thing then an infuſed and inherent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe dwelling within us: So the way of the Goſpel, is farre more eaſie then the way of the Law: See Rom. 8.3. For what the Law could not doe through the weakeneſſe of fleſh, God ſupplied. How? By ſending his Sonne both to condemne ſinne in the fleſh, and in the ſame fleſh to fulfill all righteouſneſſe: Why? That the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the Law, might be fulfilled in us. In whom? Even in weake ones who had no ſtrength, by a farre eaſier way then the Law impoſed. See alſo Rom. 10.6.7. The Law ſaith, he that doth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, ſhall live in them: But the righteouſneſſe of faith, ſaith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing: What is that? Beleeve and live: Say not, who ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to heaven? Or who ſhall deſcend into the deepe? For Chriſt hath both deſcended of his own accord to ſatisfie and aſcended thither in triumph: And this word is offered unto thee, is neere thee, is in thy mouth and thy heart to do it: &amp; the doing it, is only the beleeving it: If thou confeſſe with thy mouth, and beleeve in thy heart this ſweet eaſie way of God, thou ſhalt be ſaved. So much for the firſt Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this appeares in another reſpect alſo. The Lord aimes at <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>2</label> a further thing then the obedience of beleeving: He aimes alſo at this,<note place="margin">In reſpect of a further thing which the Lord armes at. 2 King. 3.</note> the reducing of our decaied and corrupt frame of nature, to his owne image in light and holineſſe. Now as he who aimes at a maine ſcope in a thing, thinkes it a light thing to compaſſe the meanes tending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: So it is here, take an Inſtance: <hi>Iehoram</hi> and two other Kings, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined to deſtroy <hi>Moab,</hi> in their journey they were like to periſh for lacke of water: They conſult with <hi>Eliſha:</hi> He (at laſt) tells them, This is a light thing with the Lord to give you water, and ſave your lives, for he intends a further bleſſing, to deliver <hi>Moab</hi> into your hands. It was not light to worke ſuch a miracle, but in reſpect of a further aime, it was but light: So to beleeve is not eaſie in reſpect of it ſelfe, ſo much as in reſpect of a further excellency, to reſtore us to that perfect image of God which once made us happy; it is light with the Lord to take of our guilt, to remove our curſe, and that barre which ſtood in our way by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, to keepe us from ever comming to God againe, in his pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and holineſſe of nature. This may be a ſecond reaſon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let us come from reſpective eaſe, to reall eaſe: And here we ſhall alſo finde, that in two reſpects, The obedience of faith is eaſie. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>3</label> Firſt, in reſpect of the preparation leading to it. Secondly, of the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall working of the gift of obeying the Goſpel. For the former, wee ſhall diſcover it in theſe two things: Firſt, in reſpect of the price: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of the manner of diſpenſation. Touching the former of theſe, the price was eaſie: Marke my meaning: I ſay not, that it was an eaſie price in it ſelfe conſidered:<note place="margin">Note this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> Although if ſome idle brains might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, the price ſhould not be great; for they ſay, that Chriſt was ſuch a perſon as to whom ſin could not be ſo imputed, as to take hold of him by the curſe; but God imputed this eaſe to the excellency of the perſon of his Son (being God) that inſtead of ſuffering the wrath of Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:45715:200"/> in his ſoule and body; he ſhould onely ſuffer ſo much penalty as that traitor <hi>Iudas,</hi> and thoſe enemies of his, <hi>Pilate,</hi> the Elders and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers inflicted; and this ſuffering, although in it ſelfe not equall to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, yet God the Father imputed it as an equall ſatisfaction: A moſt horrible fancy! we renounce it; and affirme, that the eaſe of the price ſtands not in him that paid it, for ſo it is the moſt full, deare and coſtly purchaſe, that ever was paid ſince the beginning, yea greater then the damned in hell pay, who by all their paying ſatisfie not: But its eaſie to us, it comes to our hands ready wrought and finiſhed, and coſts us nothing at all, the Lord doth not require of us ſo much as the wetting of one finger, or ſtirring of one joint towards a price (for it were bootleſſe) ſo we can but accept it, and apply it to our ſelves. Chriſt paid a moſt full price, to the coſt both of bearing his Fathers wrath, and deſertion for a time (although with moderation of extremities and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſements) in his ſoule, and the effuſion of the laſt drop of his heart and life bloud in his body; and leſſe then this would not, nor could not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie juſtice, for if it would it ſhould; and the Lord offered his Son wrong, if he might have taken leſſe, &amp; yet would urge more I ſay this being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that he choſe this in his wiſdome as the beſt;) and for my part, I ſee it not to be any trenching upon the omnipotency of God, or any other ends of God whatſoever, to urge this for the ſafeguard of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; for without the integrity thereof he is not God: If he would have his Son loſe his glory that he might ſatisfie juſtice, and then would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelfe with a pageant of ſatisfaction by imputing; why might not Chriſt wholly have beene ſpared as well? But this by the way: becauſe I ſee many incline to thinke God might (if he had would) ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himſelf in the pardoning of ſinne without ſatisfaction made; which Divinity paſſes my skill, and I thinke ſavours more of Socinianiſme and Humanity, then Divinity. I returne: In reſpect either of the Fathers cutting off his plea, and finding out a mercy in the bottome of his breſt exceeding juſtice and revenge; or the conſent of the Sonne to admit of thoſe conditions of obeying and ſuffering, for the purchaſe of peace, and aboliſhing enmity, Col. 1. it is moſt ſtrange, unlikely and difficult: But conſidering that he to whom all things are eaſie, would apply and bend himſelfe with all his power, wiſdome and truth, to bring his good pleaſure of free ſaving to paſſe, and would devoure all difficulties; therefore nothing could be hard, but all eaſie to ſuch love ſo armed and attended: God ſo loved the world (ſaith Saint Joh. 3.12.) that he gave his onely Sonne: But otherwiſe in it ſelfe it was a great thing. <hi>Iacobs</hi> toile in heat and froſt was great, (though love made it ſweet.) And ſo to end, though it coſt Chriſt an infinite price, yet being freely offered to us, it coſt us nothing, its eaſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>4</label> Fourthly, the diſpenſation is eaſie. In reſpect whereof, the Lord doth not reſtraine nor limit his grace,<note place="margin">In reſpect of the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</note> and the efficacy of this price, (I ſpeake now of his revealed will, not ſecret) but offers it by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Goſpel to all ſorts, without let or barre: That whoſoever will ſubmit himſelfe to his way and diſpenſation with humbleneſſe, the Lord will be found (ordinarily) by ſuch, without putting difference: He doth not ſh oll out or diſcourage any, as if hee did not intend it to
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:45715:200"/> them, he doth not reject any who reject nor him, nor forſake any (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me rightly) who forſake not him: And their rejecting or forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king proceeds not from his decree working it, but from their malice and unbeleefe procuring it: But as for the Lord,<note place="margin">2 Cron. 16.4.</note> hee doth not foreſtall or prejudicate the ſpirit of any man to his diſpenſation, but freely, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally and fully offers to all ſorts of ſinners, the benefit of his grace and pardon, who doe not baſely and treacherouſly withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and cavill againſt his ſimplicity. The Lord doth not put diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in his offer, ſaying, to ſuch or ſuch an one I offer it, to ſuch and ſuch I doe not, he offers alike to all; and although ſome conditions go before the actuall application of the promiſe, yet thoſe conditions are wrought in the ſoule by the offer in all, who doe walke with God in the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y of his Ordinances, except they fight and reſiſt the ſame. So then, whoſoever doth not deſpiſe the counſell of God,<note place="margin">Luke 4.</note> and thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unworthy of ſalvation, but ſhew himſelf of the number of them who are drawne and perſwaded to accept it, he ſhall aſſuredly partake it. So much for the fourth.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, to come a little nearer, that is, to the reall efficacy of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>5</label> grace and the obedience of faith, thats eaſie alſo. For why?<note place="margin">The conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith is eaſie to ſuch as belong to election.</note> When as the Lord hath brought the ſoule under the condition of faith, partly by loading the ſame under her miſery; partly by the preſenting to her the ſweetneſſe, gainfulneſſe and faithfulneſſe of the promiſe; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by removing all ſuch barres and lets as might diſſwade the ſoul from it; then hereby to ſuch a one, it becomes eaſie to beleeve. And to ſay the truth, to theſe its onely eaſie, in the true kinde and proper ſenſe of eaſineſſe. For why? Theſe are exempted from the common ſort of hearers, to whoſe thoughts the very conceit of faith is a difficult thing, much more the enterpriſe. For alas! Naturally, what in all the world is ſo harſh and unwelcome to our carnall diſpoſition, as to obey the Goſpel? Not to preach, to heare, to give away our wealth, to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice our children, to keepe the Law, are ſo hard as this: But to ſuch as the Lord hath brought under the authority, love and conduct of the word, and the Spirit of grace working thereby; he makes it ſweet and eaſie. Others plod and take on, make a bungling worke of it,<note place="margin">Eſay 63.12. Pſal. 23.3.</note> as we ſee untidy ſervants goe awkely about their buſineſſe, which neate and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ones diſpatch at once; but the Lord conducts theſe as a ſhepheard leads his ſheep into the greene paſtures, and as thoſe Iſraelites were led by the pillar of fire and cloud through the wilderneſſe. If a traveller be ſet right on his journey, his eaſe is in his guide: As <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſeeing <hi>Iacob</hi> bring veniſon ſo ſoone, asked him how he came ſo quickly by it? Hee told him, becauſe the Lord thy God brought it to his hand: So hee had no need of <hi>Eſau</hi> his hunting. Now briefly, it ſhall not bee amiſſe to ſhew by what ſteps the Lord makes this worke eaſie and familiar to his people.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Cernaine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of this holy eaſe. The firſt.</note> as he giveth them a ſweet view of this worke of obeying the Goſpel, that is a cleer &amp; familiar conceiving thereof, ſo that it is not an intricate and weariſome object: (As <hi>Salomon</hi> deſcribes the way of the fluggard to be an hedge of thornes, which no man is willing to medle with:) So alſo the Lord brings the ſoule unto the doore of
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:45715:201"/> hope, ſhewing it an entrance and a poſſibleneſſe of eſcape, working a knowledge of it, and withall an hearty and cloſe aime and ſympathy to it.<note place="margin">Hoſea 2.</note> It ſo plants the ſoule under the promiſe, that the droppings of Gods myrrhe, oile and balme, do not light beſide it, but right into it. When a man hath got the promiſe of a leaſe; he is ſure of the next vacancy: So men that lay in for an advouzon, waite for the next avoidance. It is a good eaſe for a poore Scholar in the Univerſity to be made a Probatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the next Fellowſhip (as in ſome Colledges they uſe) for then hee waites in hope, and is eaſed of the hazard of miſſing. Such Probatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Candidates of heaven, doth the Lord firſt make his poore people, that ſo having an inckling of his meaning, they goe on with ſweetneſſe, becauſe heaven is theirs in the grant and reverſion. As once an holy man told mee, that the Lord intimated his heart with this thought, that if he would ſeeke him faithfully in the meanes, he would ſave him. A marveilous priviledge. So that looke when any grace falls from God, they are the parties whom it will light upon; this takes off an exceeding deale of bondage, and makes meanes ſweet. So it was to them of Ninivee,<note place="margin">Jona 3.7.8.9. Judg. 14. Jer. 4.3.</note> who upon this hint from God, applyed themſelves to the meanes very carefully. This cauſes the heart to plow with Gods heifer, to finde out his riddle, and to ſee into the myſtery of the promiſe; and therefore to plow indeed and fall to worke, to rend up the fallow grounds of her proud rebellious nature, ſelfe and ſcurffe, to hunger af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſet a price upon the promiſe, as a pearle above price.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. In divers points.</note>Secondly, the Lord makes it an eaſie worke by ſetling the promiſe upon the ſoule, and that by ſundry workes: For firſt, it doth pull up all hedges and fences which ſtopt the ſoules courſe, ſtanding between the ſoule and her harmes, he puts her out of feare, and ſets her out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, removes Lions of ſuppoſed difficulty out of her way; as malice of Satan diſmaying, error of the wicked deterring, and ſelfe diſtempers which diſquiet her with doubtings: wee know if a man would goe the next way to a place and avoid dirt and bad way, hee muſt have a guide to lead him by the fields, to pull up gaps, barres and ſtops; which done, the traveller hath great eaſe. So the Lord deales for his, he ſuffers them not to travell tediouſly to heaven; that is the portion of hypocrites who undoe as faſt as they doe, and are ever new to beginne; but to his owne he gives ſweet eaſe in his way. If a man ſhould hold our enemy for us and binde him by ſtrength, it were (as we ſay) five of the ſeven, we might eaſily beat him. Thus our Lord Jeſus bindes Satan and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, that the ſoule might get the better of him, and goe forward without awckneſſe,<note place="margin">Luke 12.</note> ſelfe-love or hypocriſie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Lord makes the promiſe eaſie, by preſenting to her all the good things of it (as Canaan was ſeene eaſily by <hi>Moſes</hi> when the Lord ſhewed it unto him) and ſo ſets the ſoule in a ſweet courſe:<note place="margin">Deut 34.1, 2, 3, 4.</note> Wee know by experience, when once a man gets the ſavour and ſmack of an object, he goes roundly: A Tradeſman having taſted the reall ſweet of his returne, and a ſcholar of his booke, take ſmall thought to goe through ſtitch. <hi>Paul</hi> in that place to the Corinths, tells us that the Lord hath diffuſed the ſavour of his truth into him, and by him to others. An hypocrite is puzling after it all his life time,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.14.</note> but is ſo poiſoned with the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:45715:201"/> more welcome ſavours of his pleaſures, gaine and luſts, that he falls ſhort of the grace of God, and as it is Heb. 12. <hi>Eſau</hi> came ſhort of the bleſſing, <hi>Iaacob</hi> came juſt in the way of it and failed not: And this ſavour differs from the decaying and wanzing taſte of temporaries; it abides in the ſoule, and cauſes it to be reſtleſſe, till it poſſeſſe what it ſavours: It is as leven, ſowres the whole lumpe of minde, will, affections.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, it doth authoriſe, enable and carry the ſoule (as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> under a ſafe convoy) into the promiſe: So that (without the toile of the wicked) it holds on cheerfully in all thoſe meanes which ſhe muſt uſe, as prayer, meditation, conference, hearing; ſo that ſhe uſes not theſe at had I wiſt, hit they or miſſe they, but as ordinances under the bleſſing of God, which ſhall not returne in vaine: As <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeakes,<note place="margin">Eſay 55.9.10.</note> The ſnow and the raine returne not in vaine to him that ſent them, but cauſe the earth to bring forth corne to the eater, and ſeed to the ſower: So ſhall my word (ſaith the Lord) not faile of its ſcope, but to doe that for which I ſent it. And ſithence the Lord Jeſus ſpeakes no words in vain, but with the promiſe, addes the performance; therefore the ſoule heares it ſo, takes and findes it ſo; even as the command of Chriſt to the ſicke of the palſey, Be thou cleane, clenſed him forthwith. So then, if the Lord will have it ſo ſweet and eaſie a worke, who ſhall let it? Who ſhall diſanull it? So much for the Reaſons.</p>

And ſo in the 13. of Acts, To you (brethren, the Jewes at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch) is preached by this man forgiveneſſe of ſinnes. It was a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour though they had not the grace to ſee it: And ſo much more to all under the condition of faith the promiſe belongs, although to ſuch as are under the condition of their own ſtrength, it ſhall be a meer toile and bondage.

Commonly when the word is firſt ſent to a congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a dainty, as a rare and deſired pearle, an object of price: Againe, when the ſpirit of the hearer is carried with violence to carry the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome away, whatſoever paines and charge it coſt them; when alſo the Lord ſends the Angel or Miniſter with a more then common ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of zeale, to ſtir the muddy poole to the bottome, and to unſettle mens hearts frozen upon their dregs: I ſay, when as the Lord inſpires him with the ſpirit of <hi>Eliah</hi> or <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> with ſpeciall love to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſoules of men, with laboriouſneſſe and the ſpirit of convincing: when as the Goſpel drawes all ſorts unto it, by the fervency of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and examples of ſuch as make toward it, then there is eaſe in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Not when the Goſpel is waxen ſtale in a Towne, and Manna plentifull, which commonly cauſes loathing and fulſomeneſſe: Not when the hearers heart is ſunke and dead in his breſt, indifferent whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſpeed or no: Not when the ſpirits of the Miniſters of God wax dull, as <hi>Moſes</hi> hands with long holding up: Not when the Spirit of grace, of power, melting, drawing and perſwading, begins to flag: And (as <hi>Micah</hi> ſaith) is ſtraitned:<note place="margin">Mica 2.6.</note> Not when the hearts of Miniſters faint in them and turne another way: Not when they are driven out from their places, and are faine to ſeeke into remote Countries: Not when the affections of people wax generally dead, and careleſſe which end goe forward, rather minding their owne world, will and ends, then the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſalvation.</p>

Not in theſe ſeaſons, not in death, deepe ſickneſſes, croſſes, feares, loſſes, is there like to be found this eaſe I ſpeake of? And therefore, Oh you (my brethen who heare me this day!) who have long lived here under the meanes, (above fifty yeares) thinke ſeriouſly of your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. If yet the worke of beleeving the promiſe be undone, if you have outbidden and ſurvived all theſe happy ſeaſons, (wherein your owne ſoules know you felt ſuch dampings of corruption, raiſings of heart, thawings, inclinings and movings of ſpirit, to embrace the offer of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) and have fallen to the world, to pleaſures, to eaſe, and (as <hi>Cain</hi> did) being caſt out of Gods preſence, to goe and build Cities: Let my words now pierce you (if any tenderneſſe at roote remaine in you) and take heed leſt if ever you finde God gracious, (if he have not quite caſt you off for your dallying) you be put to toile and travell for it, leſt it coſt you tenne times as much trouble as you might firſt have had it for. The Lord is hardly drawne to returne to a particular man, when he hath left a publique place: I tell you, if you have ſlighted ſuch meanes and ſeaſons as theſe, it muſt be the unſpeakeable patience of God which can pull you home at laſt: It were ſtrange if a man who hath loſt his faire or market, ſhould come many daies after and meet with thoſe commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which hee wants, then he might have ſtored himſelfe with eaſe, but after with much hazard and coſt.</p>
               <p>You have had your ſeaſon, your accepted time and day of ſalvation;<note place="margin">Speciall appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the preſent people.</note> many hundreds have beleeved and ſet ſeale to the grace offered, and moſt of them are at reſt with God.

How ſhall I ſpeake to this wofull place for the padling out of her ſeaſon of eaſe? God hath brought ſalvation to your doores, as to the children of the Kingdome, pind it on your ſleeves, I may truly (and in a good time) ſpeake it, The Goſpel hath alway brought you more gaine then it hath coſt you: Pulpits have beene, as it were, ſet up in your ſtreets by your houſes, (ſo neere is the grace of God come unto you;) and when others have ridden and trotted five, ten, fifteene miles, you have had it at home, for ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in at the doores; floods of butter and oile have flowed downe in your brooks and ſtreets, and thouſands have beene ſatisfied with your leavings: You have been as free borne to the Goſpel; What (in all the world) ſhall you pretend for your ſelves, if you have never had (I ſay not the beſt portion) but any part at all of it: Oh! that I could teach you, (after all my preſſing of the promiſe among you) how to diſpute for your ſelves? But that exceeds my skill; you have had a fee-ſimple, an inheritance of the Goſpel, you have beene married to the Lord, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der long, conſtant, unwearied, plaine and powerfull meanes, long ere I came among you: All mens gifts have ſerved you,<note place="margin">Note you of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> you have entred into other mens labours.

For my ſelfe although I have long li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unprofitable, yet if ever God lent me any fitneſſe to doe you good, it hath beene ſince I came among you: And yet ſome of you, through lazineſſe, worldlineſſe, love of your ſhops, formality, neglect of meditation: Others through a curſt ſullen heart, ſnuffing at the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, ſtumbling at the ſtone of offence, but the moſt from a cloy'd and ſurfeited ſtomacke with much food, have never come to taſte the eaſe of mercy. If ſome few have, truly, either they have little elſe to take too, or elſe God hath pickt them out as odde ones here and there; and what may become of ſome of theſe when meanes ſhall faile, God knoweth! But now even at this laſt caſt and farewell, for Gods ſake, come in and dally no longer, and breake through all your luſts for this promiſe! It ſhall vex ye as fire one day, to thinke of this, how fooliſhly did I miſſe of heaven?

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:45715:204"/> that there is an univerſall ſufficient grace offered in the Goſpel which alſo is effectuall, except men reſiſt it, and that they have free will to accept and embrace it. As for the doctrine of Gods peculiar eaſe of perſwading ſome more then others, they cannot endure it.

And ſo if there fall out to be any defect herein, it is no want of the accommodation of grace to us, (for that is equall to all) but our accommodation to it in ſuch a due ſeaſon, matter or other circumſtances, as if they had beene concurring, might have produced a perſwaſion to receive the grace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.

Doe not as wanton heires, who ſpend it as lightly and baſely, as it came eaſily: Leſt the Lord make your hearts ake for it, and ſet you on the racke, teaching you to repent and to keep within bounds.

Surely as the Lord bids the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, who came into a land flowing with milke and hony, and that at the beſt vantage, even in the harveſt of all commodities:<note place="margin">But rather knit the heart to God.

And ſo much for the ſecond Branch of the Exhortation. I ſhould now have concluded the Uſe with the third and laſt Branch, that we walke in the experience of this bleſſed eaſe, to truſt God forth on for the like goodneſſe.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Gave you an hint briefly (beloved in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) when I laſt ended the former Sermon, what I would have proceeded with, if time had permitted. I have ſhewed you, That the beleeving of Gods promiſe (to ſuch as are in caſe) is an eaſie thing. Sundry grounds and Scriptures I cleered the truth by, and ſundry Uſes of Inſtruction, of Terror, of Reproofe, and of Exhortation I have added. And to this laſt (wherein two branches were urged <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>3</label> then) belongs a third, that is, That all who have found this handfull of eaſe,<note place="margin">The eaſe of mercy ſhould make Gods yoake light for ever after.</note> in beleeving pardon, ſhould be earneſt with God for the eaſe and ſweetneſſe of an holy courſe, that the yoake of God may become eaſie and his burthen light. Say thus unto the Lord, Hitherto thou haſt dealt with thy ſervant in mercy, thou haſt not laid heavy taskes upon me; I cannot accuſe thee (like an hypocrite) that thou haſt taken up where thou haſt not ſtrawed, nor reaped where thou haſt not ſowne: Rather I may ſay, that others have laboured, and I am entred into their labours, that is, found a ſweet and eaſie work of beleeving. Now as I bleſſe thee for this, ſo yet, be not angry with me, if I have another requeſt to make unto thee,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.24.</note> and that is, that thou wouldeſt ſtill hold the like hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:45715:206"/> me, in making the life of faith ſweet unto me, and the courſe of obedience moſt welcome and familiar. Oh! let it be no harſh thing unto me to beleeve all thy other promiſes,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.30.</note> concerning ſtrength againſt tentations, power againſt my luſts:<note place="margin">And breed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience for time to come.</note> Lord let not the difficulty of walking be as great, as the eaſe of converſion was mercifull; juſt it were with thee to make it ſo, and to try me what ſoundneſſe, what uprightneſſe were in me by hard trialls: But oh! lead me not into tentation, do not ſuffer my corruptions to wax ſtronger then I can maſter, nor Satan to be more fierce and fiery in his darts then I can reſiſt or quench: I doe not pray againſt croſſes or aſſaults, but that they may be according to man, and that an iſſue may be given with them, that I may ſay, thou haſt been afflicted with me in all my afflictions, to make them tolerable,<note place="margin">Eſay 63.9.</note> by thy meekeneſſe, confidence, patience and courage put into me: Let the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of thy preſence ſave me and conduct me, beare me up by thy hand continually, and redeeme me out of them all at laſt in an happy manner; give me O Lord, both the upper and the nether ſprings, enlarge my coaſt, and be with me againſt thoſe Cananites of the mountaines,<note place="margin">Judg. 1.15.</note> who have iron chariots! If thou ſhalt indeed bleſſe me (as <hi>Iabez</hi> ſaid) thou ſhalt be my God, 1 Chron. 4.10. Teach me mercy to the diſtreſſed, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in affliction, faith in ſtraits, ſoberneſſe in bleſſings, faithfulneſſe, if a Miniſter, ſubjection, if a wife, underſtanding, if an husband, dutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if a child, truſtineſſe, if a ſervant, and let there be ſweet eaſe in all theſe.</p>
               <p>Luſt is ſweet (Lord) to my unmortified part, but preſent thou ſuch a prevailing ſweetneſſe in thy love by thy promiſe, that it may bear down the corrupt pleaſure of my ſinne; ſo that, while thy love and the joy of thy countenance is preſent, the image of ſuch ſcurfe may bee deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and it may not be tedious to mee to reject the tentations to wrath, revenge, earthlineſſe, looſeneſſe in liberties, pride, vanity: But all theſe may become bitter to mee, thy grace making them ſo! Oh (bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren!) the Lord teach you to thinke of this: Strange it is, how many of us goe to worke with God in the way of our converſation, eſpecially if private, ſolemne, dangerous, diſgraced, hard duties be urged, wee finde our hearts ſo ſullen, weary, hollow, fickle, carnall in any duty which concernes us, as if God were highly beholding to us for our worke. What then ſhould be the pitch of our ambition with God, ſave that ſtill he would carry us upon Eagles wings, hide all difficulty of Religion from us, preſent it to us as a ſweet object, remove our way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe of will, and fill us with love, that wee comprehending the length, depth and height of it, might be filled with his fulneſſe, and be carried on without any great rubs, or ſad offences, that our heads may not be brought to our graves with ſorrow, but wee may finiſh our courſe with joy. <hi>David</hi> in that Pſalme 27.4. having found one mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with God, ſtaies not there, but laies in for a new: What is that? One thing I will aske of God that he will not deny me, That I may walke and ſpend all my daies in his houſe continually: A child findes it no trouble to him to walke in the preſence of a loving father, who pitties and provides for him! So ſhouldeſt thou. Mourne thus, if ever any thing come between my ſoul and eaſe, it will be this treacherous heart
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:45715:207"/> which will come to a point! Its that which ſo manacles and pinions my ſoule, that I cannot reach that liberty and joy which thy ſervants feele! Its that (Lord) which makes me ſo darke, ſo lowring, diſcontent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull and ſad!<note place="margin">Eſay 38.</note> Oh Lord! eaſe me here, theſe have oppreſſed me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me!

But till thy ſweetneſſe ſatisfie my ſoule, and ſoake me to the rootes, I ſhall never be as I would be, nor can thy worke bee as it ought to be! Accept therefore firſt, the will for the deed, a little for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> much, that ſhall be one vantage. Then againe, cover and hide defects, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and looke upon my better part, thine owne grace, and not my corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> interpret me with favour to the uttermoſt.

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>4</label> But there is yet a fourth branch of Exhortation behinde, flowing more neceſſarily from this Doctrine,<note place="margin">Nouriſh not feares about the way of God.</note> then any of the former: And that is this, That ſeeing the people of God, have an allowance from God of eaſe in beleeving: Therefore let all poore ſoules ſet their hearts at reſt, and not nouriſh fears within themſelves of a more tedious entrance into the Kingdome of Grace, then the Lord hath promiſed. Nay rather, let them faſten upon this priviledge, not looking at themſelves, but at him, who hath all impoſſibilities at his becke, and can turne them to eaſe. In which reſpect <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid to beleeve, that (although in ſhew <hi>Sara's</hi> wombe was to be barren, yet) becauſe God was able to make good his word, therefore from one who was as dead, ſhould iſſue thouſands. Thus faith gives glory to God, and drownes her owne fears in his power: True it is, wee cannot beleeve that God will make his promiſe eaſie till we beleeve: But one excellent argument to draw us to beleeve, is, the meditation of it as an eaſie worke, and that the Lord can and will make it ſo. As I noted before, the cauſe why ſo many ſtart and ſhrinke from the way of God, is the conceit of the moſt noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and tedious hardneſſe of it. The ſluggard ſtill cries, A Lion is in the way,<note place="margin">Proverb.</note> I dare not goe. Take we heed of this bondage: Wee cannot diſhonour God more deadly, then by an ill conceit of him, and his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of beleeving. For wiſdome is eaſie to him that loveth underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; if God will make it ſo, why ſhouldeſt thou gainſay it? A lowring, ſullen heart, cauſeth this ſlavery in us; wee are willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that which we wiſh: but looke what we have ſmall liſt unto, that we naturally frame to our ſelves very difficult.<note place="margin">Counſells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this diſeaſe.</note> Strive firſt to get a true judgement of the way of converſion, that the Lord hath ſaid its eaſie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Its that which <hi>Naamans</hi> ſervants here labour to beat into their Maſter, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and by it prevailed with him for the obeying of the promiſe. Next ſtrive to get under the condition of it, for all ſuch are at next door to it. To this end, inſtead of ſtudying thy ſelfe and thine owne abilities, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the promiſe, and let that draw thee to be in love with him, who hath
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:45715:207"/> ſo freely offered it; that will winne thy affections to it; and when thy heart is taken with it, thou ſhalt ſoone be on thornes to enjoy it. The eaſe of beleeving iſſues from the ſoules getting under the condition of the promiſe. Touching which point, becauſe it will offer it ſelfe in the next verſe more fully, I ſay the leſſe here. That which in a word I will preſſe here (and ſo finiſh) is this, Reſiſt faiths enemy which is bondage, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> an ill opinion of God, a conceit that he love, our toile and vexation; and nouriſh faiths friend, which is Gods eaſe, and that he is no hard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, no tyrant, no taske-maſter, but one that delights in a cheerfull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyer, and faith will follow ſweetly. God loves one that will not bee ſcared away with Lions and Beares, but come to God for eaſe with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that its eaſie for him to give: The cauſe why there is ſuch difficulty in beleeving, comes not from God; but it comes from our falſe opinion and a ſtrange conceit that all pretious things muſt bee dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult.</p>
               <p>It coſts the Lord exceeding paines to baniſh out this error, which if it were once overcome, its not to be ſaid, what incredible eaſe would appeare: Therefore let thy courſe (poore ſoule) be, to beg of God the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> benefit of this eaſe; pray to him and ſay, If the way to heaven be of thy meer inventing, if the Lord Jeſus himſelf be thy free gift, if the offer of him to a loaden heart be free and voluntary, if the gift of faith it ſelf be thine, and thou haſt bound thy ſelf both to give feet to come and to give eaſe to the ſoule that commeth, where lies the difficulty? Surely in the ſlaviſh heart, which feares where no feare is, which judges of God according to her owne ſenſe. Now to ſenſe and fleſh who dare ſay, or when did ever God ſay faith was eaſie? Come to him then and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune him for this eaſe: Lord take away my ſlaviſh heart, I have wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full experience, what my moyling and toyling wit and courſe is able to doe: At the firſt, I liked it well as mine owne ſtrength; but now I am tired with it; I ſee its thy plague, thou giveſt toyle to the wicked, but to the good and pleaſing in thy ſight, eaſe and reſt: To hunt and to roſt that they have got in hunting, to labour moderately, and to eat of the fruit thereof: Oh this bleſſing I want! Lord, all the fiſh in the ſea are at thy call, thou canſt in a moment gather them all together into one place:<note place="margin">Luke 5. Joh. ult. Gen. 18.14.</note> Thou canſt bid <hi>Peter</hi> ſpread his net, juſt where they are, and encloſe multitudes in it, after he had fiſhed all night and catcht nothing. Alas! he caſt out his net on the wrong ſide all the while; but when the Lord Jeſus came, then he caſt on the right ſide, and catcht abundance. At thy command Lord, a dead heart ſhall be quickned, a dead wombe ſhall conceive, a creeple of thirty eight yeares ſhall be healed, and what hard thing hath not turned eaſie at thy command?</p>
               <p>What was eaſier then to goe through the red ſea firſt, and then Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den dryſhod, when thou cauſedſt the windes to keep up the waters like two walls on both ſides, and to dry up the mud in the midſt? What is hard ſave becauſe of lets? And what is not eaſie if barres be removed? Oh therefore Lord! thou who by that miracle madeſt <hi>Peter</hi> a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and gaveſt him a ſigne that he ſhould be a fiſher of men, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe three thouſand at one Sermon; teach me this bleſſed gift, make me ſuch a Preacher of reconciliation by thy skill and eaſe:<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> And thou
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:45715:208"/> who broughteſt all fiſhes under the net, bee not diſcouraged by my ſhineſſe, feare and loathneſſe to bee driven in: Say but the word, and I ſhall come under it, and thy Miniſter ſhall caſt out on the right ſide and encloſe me! Oh happy ſoule! if after all my tricks and wiles to ſhunne thee, thou ſhalt at the laſt, make my will willing, and cauſe me to come under the ſweet and yet authority of thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: I crave not <hi>Lydia's</hi> eaſe, <hi>Zachees</hi> eaſe, I know now thy courſe is more leaſurely: I doe not ſo much ſeeke ſhortneſſe of labour, as ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit, and meekeneſſe of heart, and ſureneſſe of ſucceſſe, and riddance of my baſeneſſe and contradictions: The wilderneſſe ſhall be as welcome to me, as the way of the Philiſtins, if thou wilt tame my rebellions, and give me a pledge of Canaan at laſt! The Lord will not ſtop his eare to ſuch a prayer; mercy pleaſeth him, and the eaſe of mercy pleaſeth him; what ſhould hinder him from giving that which pleaſeth him? Onely our owne eaſe ſet up againſt his, makes the way to heaven tedious, if that be removed, heaven will bee as eaſie as this cure was by waſhing in Jorden.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>5</label> I proceed now to the fifth Uſe which is Admonition and Caveat: <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Admonition. Wiſdome is needfull to judge of the eaſe of grace.</note> That notwithſtanding all which hath beene ſaid about this point, yet that we be wiſe and diſcreet in our judgements, both concerning Gods diverſity of diſpenſation, and concerning the eſtates of men. For the firſt, although I have ſaid nothing but the truth of God hitherto, yet this muſt not breed ill bloud in us, when we conſider his caſting off thouſands, yea millions of people, both ſuch as are without the pale of the Church, and ſuch as are viſible members by Baptiſme: It may ariſe in the mindes of ſome to thinke, that if the way of God were eaſie, why ſhould the Lord hide it from ſo many generations, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning till now, (for ought we know) among Pagans and Infidels? And why ſhould ſo many among our ſelves after their long knowledge and uſe of meanes, yet finde it ſo hard a taske and come ſhort of it when all is done? The anſwer whereto is, That the ſecret waies of God are not for us to deſcant upon: If he will conceale this way of his from many for ſpeciall cauſe, we muſt ſay. Knowne unto the Lord are all his wayes and workes from the beginning.<note place="margin">Act. 15.18.</note> Hebrew, Greeke and Latine are things eaſie and familiar to ſome children, but they who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had training,<note place="margin">Judge not raſhly either of Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke,</note> never come to know them; they are theirs whoſe lot it was to have good education. Its the lot of ſome Countries to have plentifull Mines of gold and ſilver, and its no hard matter for ſuch to dig it out of the earth:<note place="margin">Act. 17.38.</note> But they whoſe lot it is to have no ſuch priviledge, know not what the eaſe thereof meanes. Therefore the wofull forſaking of them, and paſſing by thoſe times of ignorance, muſt not make us thinke, that thoſe to whom the Lord reveales it, finde it to be a difficulty. Its eaſie onely to ſuch as the Lord makes it ſo; Whom he will he ſhewes mercy unto, and whom he will he hardneth. Such ſecrets as theſe muſt be trembled at and adored, not deſcanted; rather thoſe whoſe portion it is to bee ſo mildly and eaſily drawne home to God, ſhould applaud and magnifie his goodneſſe to them as a peculiar priviledge, and ſay, He hath not done thus to every Nation, neither
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:45715:208"/> have all knowne his wayes. That which hath beene impoſſible for ſome to reach unto, we have beene borne unto as free men, and have found it eaſie and ſweet unto us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let not us judge the eſtates of ſuch,<note place="margin">Or private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations.</note> as whom the Lord hath exerciſed with long difficulties in this point of beleeving: I need not inſtance: Its well knowne to all that obſerve Gods government, how different it is in this kinde; how ſweetly and ſafely the Lord hath drawne and carryed on the courſe of ſome of his ſervants with eaſe and comfort: And yet, how many others, not inferior in grace unto them, have beene brought through a thicket to heaven. Paradiſe and Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory are not more contrary notions, then the eſtates of theſe two. How many holy men Preachers and others have led weariſome dayes, nights and yeares, in their conflict and continuall combat of their unbeleefe? How intricate hath Satan and Melancholy made their conditions, that they have thought it as impoſſible for them to beleeve, as to climbe up to the clouds? The Lord knowes why he ſuffers ſuch holy, humble and hungry ſoules to be ſo long tozed and diſquieted without eaſe; ſome to ſee ſinne more bitter in the croſſe and curſe of Chriſt, then in all legall terrors, and ſome to dye ſo;<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> not to teach us to judge them (for no doubt they are comprehended of him, whom they comprehend not) but to tremble and adore the Soveraignty of God, who will as it were ſtep out of his courſe when he pleaſeth, and is bound to none, and hath it in his owne hands, how and by what way hee will bring his to heaven. So much for this fifth Uſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, this ſhould be Encouragement and Comfort: That although the helpes and meanes under which they live are poore, their wits ſilly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>6</label> their memories weake, their courage ſmall, their feares great,<note place="margin">Comfort and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to poore ſoules by this eaſe.</note> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell mighty to beat them off, their friends ready to diſcourage, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, their own hearts moſt ready to diſmay and give them the ſlip; yet the Lord having drawn them truly to ſeek him, he can make the way eaſie, and can fight as well with few as with many: He can make a way through Euphrates for his remnant to returne by, as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, His bare word ſpeaking cauſeth the light to appeare, 2 Cor. 4.6. and one word of his mouth will cauſe the light of grace to ſhine in the heart, and ſcatter all darkeneſſe at once. Oh! how ſhalt thou hold up thine head before the Lord when he hath made thy way eaſie, if thou by thy baſe ſloth and preſumption, or ſtoutneſſe and rebellion, or by the minding of other traſh, ſhalt make thy ſelfe uncapable of it? When the Lord promiſes to carry thine Arke above all rocks and mountaines, and to ſet it downe at length in ſafety upon dry land, that yet thou wilt not betruſt thy ſelfe to it, nor reſigne up thy feares unto him! Oh, thou ſhalt be ſpeechleſſe when the Lord comes againſt thee! Therefore (to finiſh the point) beare thy ſelfe upon this ſweet priviledge of eaſe and enjoy it; was not <hi>Ruth</hi> willing to enjoy the favour of eaſie gleaning?

No ſurely, ſhe and her mother both tooke it as from God.

The two lepers having found ſuch an eaſie booty, could not bee quiet till they had declared it to the Kings houſe; declare it thou to thy wife, to thy poore children, let it be as a loadſtone to pull their hearts to the promiſe, Come my child, I ſee thou feareſt thou ſhalt never get any thing; but looke not thou at thine owne awckneſſe, looke at the Lords eaſe: I looked to have met with as hard a bargaine of it as ever did any; but no ſooner had the Lord tired me with mine owne wraſtlings, and humbled me under the hope of his ſweet eaſe, but my chiefe worke was over. Even ſo, get downe thy heart, ſubdue it to Gods promiſe, and all ſhall be ſweet and eaſie. If a Lady being ſued too by a King to be his wife, ſhould anſwer, were I a Queene I would ſoone hearken: but alas I am a poore Lady! Would the King affect her?

                  <hi>Abigail</hi> hearing that <hi>David</hi> had ſent for her to be his wife, made a great matter of it, but ſeeing he would needs have it ſo, rejected it not, though ſhe was not meet to waſh the feet of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 18.23.</note> And <hi>David</hi> though he ſaid, Seems it an eaſie thing unto you to be the Kings ſonne in law?

                  <note place="margin">The ſecond argument of the ſervants Naamans love and reſpect to Eliſha.</note>Now I proceed to the ſecond: And that is the love, eſteeme and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute wherein their Maſter formerly had had the Prophet. They ſaw it now to bee weakened through prejudice, therefore they put him in minde of it, and (as in the next point we ſhall heare) doe rectifie him in that error. But for the preſent, the argument (coucht ſecretly) is this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f thou loveſt and eſteemeſt the Prophet really, obey him and bee ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by him: thou wouldeſt have done any thing he ſhould bid thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the honour thou bareſt him. Doe ſo ſtill, if thou love him, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his counſell. This their argument breakes it ſelfe into two parts: Firſt, into a ground of reaſon. Secondly, into the reaſon following upon it. The ground is, Thou eſteemeſt and honoureſt Gods Prophet. The reaſon, therefore take his loving counſell. Of both theſe in order in handling this ſecond argument, if God will.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The cleering of the ground.</note>Touching this ground of <hi>Naamans</hi> eſteeme of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> becauſe I doubt not but many will cavill about it, let me firſt cleere it, and then come to the point. Some will ſay then, what wonder, if ſo ſtrange and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a cure of a deſperate diſeaſe as <hi>Naamans</hi> was, did attract extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary affection, and cauſe a deſire of gratification? But thats nothing to our love to Gods Miniſter, which if it be ſound, muſt ariſe upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bottome: But to that I anſwer two wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, though <hi>Naaman</hi> of himſelfe was carryed as an ordinary man, yet the Lord having the ordering now of his whole courſe, bred as well good affections to the Prophet, and to God his owne glory and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as it bred gladneſſe of the cure: So that, even in this love of his (being in the bud) may be diſcovered a ſeed of that which after brake
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:45715:209"/> out when hee was healed. We read of the like example, Joh. 9. of a poore blinde creature, who no ſooner was healed by our Saviour of his blindeneſſe, but his affections of love brake out ſtrangely towards him; ſhall we thinke that becauſe the occaſion hereof was his cure, therefore there was no more in it, ſave a meer carnall humour? No; if we read the 37. and 38. verſes, we ſhall ſee what fire this ſparkle brought forth when our Lord Jeſus had met him, and enlarged him with more grounds, to love him upon better reaſon.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, I ſay, it were well, if even we having deeper and ſtronger bottomes to build our affections upon to Gods Miniſter, were carryed with no leſſe demonſtration then he was, of which, more in the Uſe ſhall be ſpoken. And whereas its objected, that now his ſervants rather tax him for his want of preſent love to the Prophet, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him for the former. I anſwer, what wonder if ſo weake a man were ſo eaſily tranſported in his paſſion from his former affection? Firſt, it was God who ſuffered it for his humiliation: And ſecondly, how many who thinke themſelves to ſtand upon ſurer ground in their love to the Miniſter, yet upon farre leſſer occaſion then <hi>Naamans,</hi> even meer tetches and pritches, very toyes and conceits, can alienate their love from the Prophet of God, and that both more deeply then <hi>Naaman</hi> and without repenting thereof, which yet he preſently did. So that the truth is, we have no ſuch cauſe to cavill againſt this point, nor to diſdaine to take <hi>Naaman</hi> to bee our example; rather it were well if wee would prove as good Scholars, as hee is meete to ſet us to Schoole.</p>
               <p>The point then is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctrine.</hi> The eſteeme of Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ought to be precious.</note> The eſteeme and love of heart wherewith wee embrace the Miniſter of God, ought to be ſingular. If the Prophet (ſay they) had bidden thee do ſome great thing, wouldeſt thou not have done it? Sure, it muſt bee great affection which ſhould ſo eaſily cauſe a man to doe great things? Whether we underſtand their words in relation to his obedience, to any charge which the Prophet ſhould have put upon him for the cure of his diſeaſe, or in relation to his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe, to beteame the Prophet a deep gratification for his labour; both muſt needs argue love and eſteeme. If the Prophet had told thee thou muſt goe barefoote on pilgrimage many miles, or fought ſome battell of great hazard or the like, wouldeſt not thou have adventured thy ſelfe to get thy diſeaſe cured? If the Prophet ſhould have required at thine hands ſome rich recompence, talents of ſilver, coſtly apparrel, the moſt curious preſents that could be, wouldeſt not thou have freely granted them? How much more then, when he ſaith unto thee, Waſh and be cleane? So then <hi>Naamans</hi> love (wee ſee) runnes in a ſtrong ſtreame, a ſmall thing ſhould not part him and the Prophet, he would doe great things for him rather then faile, let but the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a taske, or aske a reward, and what would not hee doe? Nay freely, unasked, unexpected? So that the point is plaine, That the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which Gods Miniſter (if the faithfull Miniſter of Chriſt) deſerves at our hands, is and ought to be ſingular and pretious. This point firſt, I will prove by Reaſon, then by Scripture, and ſo come to Uſe.</p>

               <p>The firſt Reaſon is, the charge of God. Its eternall, and cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed. I enter not now upon the ſtrickt queſtion of Tithes, (my Text reacheth onely to the ſingularity of loyalneſſe and love, and that other <label type="milestone">

God hath both in the old and new Teſtament, moſt cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly provided that the Miniſter ſhould never be forſaken.

And becauſe theſe Texts do trench rather upon the fruits of love, then the affection it ſelf: How were the Galathians affected to <hi>Paul,</hi> Did they thinke their eyes too deare for him, to pull out and give him? Are not the very feet of them beautifull, who bring glad tidings of peace and good things? Did not thoſe Galathians receive <hi>Paul</hi> as an Angel of God?<note place="margin">Gal. 4.15.</note> Would not they have imparted to him not onely their goods, but even their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoules?

If the love which they utter bee greater, muſt not the duty of love be ſo which they owe them? So then, God will have the people to tender, eſteem and honour the Miniſter: Its a charge which no time, no preſcription can alter.</p>

This will make thee doe great things for the Prophet, this will ingratiate and make him as one of a thouſand unto thee. Shall any thing now part him and me?<note place="margin">Act. 8.</note> Thinke we that the Eunuch (as ſpeedily as <hi>Philip</hi> was ſnatcht from him) carried him not away with him in his heart? Should mony, travell, feare or danger, ever have ſeparated them? Oh brthren! let this example here of <hi>Naaman,</hi> ſoke as oile into our ſpirits! And before you depart hence, beg it of God, that he would teach you the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſoule to his Miniſter: And then we will give up our ſelves (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes) firſt to the Lord, and then to him in a league of faithfull amity: Make but this ſure that we have received his meſſage,<note place="margin">Rom. 18.</note> and then there needs no more. That will be a principle within to dictate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the reſt; be the fruits greater or ſmaller, ſo that love be the guide, all ſhall be well. The odds which <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon</hi> ſpeakes of, Thou oweſt me thine owne ſoule: And that which our Saviour ſpeakes of, To give a cup of cold water, we know, is very large and different; yet where love is the roote, both are accepted with God, and all the ſteps which paſſe betweene: Love may be truſted for the meaſure, for ſhee hath an inſtinct which teacheth her what to doe; ſhee can purge the heart of ſcantneſſe and ſtraitneſſe, and enlarge it with openneſſe and freedome. If Popiſh and ungrounded love be ſo full and free, ſhall love truly rooted be barren? Shall error bee more powerfull then truth? No, no: The favour of love that comes from a ſoule redeemed with the pretious bloud of Chriſt, excells all other reſpects whatſoever, and carryes more demonſtration with it. And if love beare the ſway, a true Miniſter of Chrſt will be as free to impart himſelfe to the pooreſt and meaneſt of his congregation, who can make him little requitall, as to the richeſt and beſt; yea although he be at ſome coſt with them alſo, as in ſome caſes of diſtreſſe, and viſiting of the ſicke it may be expected from him: The loadſtone which drawes his heart in pitty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, being the grace and neceſſity of the parties, rather then his own advantage.</p>

                  </gap>aven about it, [SINCERITY.] And truly, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; to apply this, I ſay the true preſent of a ſoul won to God by the peace of reconciliation, is an heart (though not of gold, yet more preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) even made of love and openneſſe, with ſincerity of affection: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this we cannot receive the Miniſter of Chriſt aright; we may blear his eyes with falſe colours, but God is not mocked. It behooves us to hope the beſt of all, whom we cannot convince of the contrary: But except this principle be ingrafted firſt, all other ſhewes will vaniſh, and a falſe heart muſt one way or other, bewray her ſelfe. This open ſincere heart, is the beſt preſent for a Preacher, and that which will doe great things if need be, as <hi>Naaman</hi> was here ready to do: It ſaith to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, there is mine heart, take that in pawn, and the reſt will follow. But an iron cloſe hollow heart, is poiſon to a Miniſter. The Jeſuits begged of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of France, that he would bequeath them his heart in token of his eſteeme, which they keep in a golden cup in one of their Chappells. Let us doe ſo to the Miniſter of Chriſt, and as I ſaid, let not Fryers and Jeſuits prevaile more with their votaries for their hearts, then faithfull meſſengers from heaven with their people. That which is well for the preſent among us, brethren, I commend: (If the Goſpel had not ſome friends, it could not be ſo well as it is) onely take heed, that bad times eclipſe it not: But I ſpeake as I doe, becauſe daies of peace, are not as daies of trouble; among ſome good hearts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, many are hollow, and the beſt may amend, and learne to bee confirmed to doe that they doe, upon grounds of conſcience: And I deſire the Lord that without prejudice wee might heare this truth and receive it.</p>
               <p>Aske thine heart whence is it, that my affections are ſo blunt, and dead towards Gods Miniſter? The more I am loved the leſſe I love, 2 Cor. 12.15. What? Did his meſſage never pierce my ſoule? Did it never convince me to be a ranke enemy of God by nature? That the wrath or favour of the Almighty was my life or death? Did it never convince me of this, that the Lord Jehovah hath in the bloud of his owne ſonne, deviſed, offered, ſealed up a reconciliation, and that for me? Alas! what wonder, if the hearth of that Altar be cold, whereon Gods fire was never kindled. O Lord! work the ſenſe of the meſſage of immortality and life in me by the Spirit of grace, and then I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the honour and worth of thy Miniſter with a ſpirituall eye, and that common baſe judgement of the world ſhall vaniſh! Then ſhall his feet be beautifull, his face and voice pretious, and his love above the love of any earthly object.<note place="margin">Job 33.</note> Then ſhall I call him (with <hi>Elihu</hi>) one of a thouſand! For where one Miniſter cares for reconciliation himſelfe, or teacheth it to others, ſome others doe not; ſo they have the fleece, what care they whether men ſinke or ſwim! Oh! Now I ſee, its a rare grace for a Miniſter to priſe a ſoule, to tremble at the loſſe of it, to value
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:45715:217"/> it at the price of the bloud of the eternall God and the loſſe thereof, as the ſpilling of the heart bloud of Chriſt! Oh Lord! Didſt thou meane a poore ſoule ſo well as to give him a part in this bloud? And to ſend me tidings thereof by the meſſenger of peace, thy Miniſter ſealing up that unto me on earth, which in heaven thou haſt granted me? My goodneſſe, my thanks cannot reach thee, but it ſhall fall upon thy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, whoſe bleſſed voice thou haſt cauſed to ſound in mine eares, and to convey thy love into my ſoule!

When I read of the ſtrange adventures of men for the pleaſing of their Lords and Commanders, methinks it ſhames us Chriſtians! Its recorded of the ſouldiers of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, who hearing that he deſired a way to be made for his army over a certaine broad River, then beſet with the ſhips of the enemy: They put their ſwords in their mouthes, and drew thoſe ſhips ſurpriſed to the ſhore, and conveied over the army in them? What was this but for the pleaſing of a mortall man? But when as (one day) the ſoule ſhall be ſummoned before God, and demanded by the Judge, what ſingular thing haſt thou done to put it out of queſtion, what love thou beareſt to me? What a wofull regret will it be when it can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think it ſelfe of nothing, ſave ſhreds and parings?</p>
               <p>We could beteame that God ſhould ſtraine himſelfe to a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome great thing for us: If it were to make the Sunne ſtand ſtill, or goe backe ten degrees, to worke ſome miracle, or ſhew ſome ſigne from heaven of love to us, that it might appeare how great we are in his bookes! And we make ſmall account of ſmall bleſſings which others

The Lord bad <hi>Abraham</hi> do a great thing for him, even kill his ſon, and he was ready to do it, and the Lord ſaid, Now I know that thou loveſt me indeed: But if he ſhould put us to ſuch ſelfe-deniall, or try us with hard duties, we rather would hang downe the head with that young man, and goe away ſorrowfull: So that he might ſay of us, I have tried thee now, and found, that thy wealth, thy liberty, wife, children are dearer to thee then my ſelfe, I will truſt thee no more!

               <p>The which is,<note place="margin">The ſecond branch of this Argument.</note> the application and urging of this truth upon their Maſter, If thou wilt do ſuch great things out of thy love to the Prophet, then ſhew it by reall obeying his counſell; <hi>q. d.</hi> elſe, all thy ſhews are naught worth.</p>
               <p>The point is, True love and honour to a Prophet,<note place="margin">

No, he will conclude, ſurely this man ſlights my counſell and followes his owne wayes whatſoever I ſay, therefore for my part, I leave him to them who can ſway him more with their counſell then I can. How much more then is it thus with the Miniſter? If he ſee his people court him in their carriage, complement with him in ſpeech and curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, but ſtill abide the old men, reforme nothing amiſſe, goe on ſtill in their courſe, what ſhall he conclude? Surely this, I ſee this people loves me not, for I can prevaile with them in nothing, their owne waies they will take, though I teare my tongue to the ſtumps, therefore ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they love me little or not at all.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> there is a reciprocall affection of people to Miniſter as well as of Miniſter to God and Chriſt. Now the Miniſter out of a loyall heart of love to God and Chriſt, doth as he is bidden, God ſaith, If thou love me feed my lambes and my ſheep, elſe pretend no love to colour thy ſloth and negligence. Even ſo ſhould the Miniſter of God ſay to the people, If you love me obey my counſell, and do as I teach; elſe colour not over your falſhood with pretences: As the Miniſter is to carry himſelfe to God, ſo are they (under God) to carry themſelves to him. It will bee ſmally to their comfort, if all the obedience lye upon his ſhouldiers, for although he hath ſaved his owne ſoule, yet no thanke to them:<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.</note> But when there is a reciprocation of affection with the fruit of obedience, then ſhall neither grudge at other: Both ſtand in equall obligation to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, if both performe it, there is mutuall cauſe of joy and love, but if one be faithfull to God, and the other unfaithfull to him, there will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall drawing in the yoake, and great cauſe of complaint.</p>

                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:45715:219"/> its equall and righteous that they requite love for love, duty for duty: That they ſet his crowne upon his head by their faithfull obedience. The buſineſſe concernes themſelves very ſadly, for the Miniſter prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches not, comforts not, exhorts not for his owne ends, but for theirs: If then he be for them and not himſelfe; ſhall they be able to anſwer it, if they be not for their owne ſoules? Alas! what ſhall the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they afford to the Miniſter, hurt him? Shall it not redound to them? See Heb. 13.17. That were ſmally to their comfort. He is from God, and as in the ſtead of Chriſt, doing his Embaſſage. As <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſpeakes to thoſe rebells, Chap. 44. Lo I am before you, you may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me as you will: But know, that he who ſent me, will not be ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily anſwered,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.16.</note> he will pay ye home for your rebellion. If the Miniſter be bound to follow God, and not cunning deviſes and fables of his own head, and muſt give a ſtrict account thereof to his Maſter: Woe be to them that perceive not nor lay to heart! What a ſolemne account will lye upon them if they diſpiſe that meſſage, which he delivers upon ſuch tearmes: He hath ſaved his ſoule, but thy bloud ſhall be upon thine owne head. True love then is judicious, (ſee 2 Cor. 5.14.) and as in all other things, ſo in this; ſhe is loath to offer any meaſure to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, which ſhe is loath God ſhould offer herſelfe.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, love is marveilous tender. He then that loves his Miniſter, is very ſenſible of that griefe and diſcontent, which muſt needs ſmites his heart when he ſees his labours ſlighted,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> eſpecially if he be a man wholly ſet to ſeek Gods ends in preaching. A good heart will ſay, I warrant you, it ſtings the heart of him who teaches us ſoundly, to behold in us ſlight acceptance: Oh this will breed bad bloud! This will load him with ſorrow, and he hath no whither to goe for eaſe, but to him who ſet him on worke: And the Lord will take his wrongs to heart, and count them his owne, and that will prove ſad for us. Oh! let us not provide ſo ill, let us not cut downe the onely prop we ſtand on; let us condole him in his heavineſſe, and remove the cauſe of it; that ſo his heart being joyed, may procure a good errand to heaven in our behalfe, and bring downe a bleſſed anſwer from God unto us.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>4</label> Fourthly, love is given to eſteem highly of that which it loves, unites it and ſtrengthens it ſelfe in the object delighted in, ſhe ſets it up in her heart exceedingly, and good cauſe why; for love proceeds from ſome convinced amiableneſſe and worth in the thing loved, and that reflects backe honour and eſteeme. Now if it be ſo, then love of a Miniſter will breed honour to him, under God, neither under his worth nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it, but ſutable to it; contrariwiſe, if there be ſmall or no love, what will the anſwer be? Tuſh! what is he? He is but a man as others, yea and perhaps a weake one, a man of paſſions and frailties: So then marke: A loveleſſe heart deſpiſeth a Miniſter, ſhames him, is as rottenneſſe to his bones, thwarts the doctrine, makes all that behold him in the mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of ſuch people to thinke, they have a Miniſter of like diſpoſition to themſelves, elſe (for ſhame) they would not be ſo baſe.</p>
               <p>I conclude then, true love will deviſe with her ſelfe, what will grace and magnifie the Miniſter and his labours, and finding that nothing will do it ſo much as the obeying of his voice; they will force and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:45715:219"/> themſelves out of the meer nature of their love to obey him to the uttermoſt, coſt it them never ſo much the ſetting on; as face anſwers face in water;<note place="margin">Proverb.</note> ſo doth the life of an hearer who loves his Miniſter an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his labours. Love muſt needs deſtroy it ſelfe, if it ſhould diſeſteem her object; therefore ſhe honoureth that, as ſhe would ſupport her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. So much for Reaſons.</p>
               <p>This point, firſt affords Terror to all baſely minded men, who live <label type="milestone">

But oh wofull creatures! Reproach of Miniſters, ſhame and ſpots of aſſemblies, you need not to hunt them out: Read but that in Mica 2.6.7. and there you ſhall finde God himſelf will doe it for you: You ſay, propheſie not: But I ſay,<note place="margin">Ezek. 3.26.</note> they ſhall not propheſie unto ſuch, leſt they take ſhame: I will not ſuffer their faces to be covered with ſuch confuſion, as to be plagued with ſuch: I will rid them from among ſuch, and carry them to a people that love them: As for theſe haters of them, when as once their ſhepheards are gone, I will come in among them and worry them that worried theſe: And I will let in a flood upon them of woe, when my <hi>Noa's</hi> are taken into mine Arke: That which they ſought for, revenge of my Miniſter, I will inflict as a revenge upon them, and when they ſee themſelves left to be conſumed by thoſe luſts of theirs, which they ſcorned to be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out by him, then they ſhall roare for very anguiſh, ſome here under penury, rags, ſhame, diſeaſes and impenitency, ſome in hell, but then one houre of a faithfull Miniſter ſhall not be given them if they had the world to give for it. Beware leſt (ſeeing the fearefull examples of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance in Scripture for contempt of the Miniſter, beſides daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the ſudden end of ſcorners and perſecutors, will not draw you from your trade) God make you examples for others to take war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by.

<pb n="400" facs="tcp:45715:220"/> but not till then. It is irkeſome unto them to obey him in the Lord in matters of conſcience: For why?

Oh baſe creatures! Doe ye firſt crooke the rule by which you are to write, and doe ye then write after it? Thus it was with him, 1 King. 21. who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent for <hi>Micaja</hi> to <hi>Ahab,</hi> would needs teach him his leſſon by the way: Let (I pray thee) thy words be ſutable to the words of the foure hundred Prophets, and then my Maſter will ſurely doe as thou biddeſt him.

But oh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people! Is this to heare him or to obey your luſts?</p>
               <p>When <hi>Iehoiada</hi> was dead, the Text tells us, that his Princes came to <hi>Ioaſh,</hi>

Oh ſay they! We are all thy loyall ſubjects and friends, willing to be thy ſervants: But we ſee that except thou hearken in the point of Religion to thy people, they will ſcarce continue in their loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all obedience: Wherefore it is much for thy ſafety and honour to yeeld to them, and elſe it will create much trouble in thy Kingdome: And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thus fares it with people of this ranke towards their Miniſter.

Oh, Sir, ſay they, we ſee you are a man of worth and learning, and you make us good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, we ſhould be glad to live and love together, and we hope you will be faire and curteous to us: We love to keepe our Church and live honeſtly: Indeed we are ſhy of them that are ſo zealous and preciſe in their preachings, as to ſcare their good people, we would be loath the hearts of your Pariſh ſhould be alienated from you, which we ſee will be if you be againſt our liberties, pleaſures and good fellowſhips: Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto we have lived well and like kinde neighbours, and we hope you will further rather then hinder it, and ſo doing, we ſhall live in peace
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:45715:220"/> and good will with you: Oh how ſuch ſmooth perſons fret like a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker!

Alas! they are taken and ſnared by ſuch baites, and that little ſparkle of good which ſeemed to be in them, is ſoone quenched! But to finiſh this Uſe, beware (O Miniſter of God) leſt thou be deceived with ſuch cunning of men! and as for them that do ſo entice them, that they might the more ſecurely live in their luſts: Woe be unto them! they may ſeeme to make a league with hell, to provide a ſafety and immunity to their luſts: But the Lord will breake their league and put a ſpirit of diviſion betweene them, ſo that they ſhall be as bitter enemies as ever they were friends, and all becauſe their union was curſed, and tyed by the band of their luſts: (As <hi>Sampſons</hi> Foxes were tyed by their tailes with firebrands to doe miſchiefe) but not with the band of grace and love, which would have held for continuance.

Its almoſt counted as treaſon now to ſtrive with the Prieſt, he is thought halfe a Publican, who lives in any conteſt with the Miniſter, or is ill affected to him, and yet he or ſhe are as rare to be found almoſt as black ſwans, who obey their Miniſter for Gods cauſe. Therefore as we would love him (or God rather in him) ſo be we ſure we obey him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, you will ſay? I anſwer, ſince the holy Ghoſt hath traced out the way himſelfe: I will inſiſt in his owne ſteps.<note place="margin">Eſay 50.10.11. 2 Cor. 5.20. &amp; 6.1.</note> One ſolemne proofe of obeying the voice of the Miniſter is, to beleeve Gods promiſe. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not the grace of God in vaine: Be reconciled to God. Who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you (ſaith <hi>Eſay</hi>) that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the voice of his ſervant, that walketh in darkeneſſe and hath no light? Let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay himſelfe upon his God: Let him not compaſſe himſelfe about with ſparkes, nor walke in the light of his own fire which he hath kindled.</p>
               <p>Marke: This is a ſound triall of obeying the Miniſter,<note place="margin">Some Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of love.</note> if we ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> our owne wills and carnall reaſon, reject all our falſe colours and ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceptions, and embrace the promiſe of the Goſpel, to beleeve and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. This is the weighteſt charge that God hath given him to urge, and it is the greateſt ſeal which we can ſet to his Miniſtery, if we beleeve it. In this one obedience we lay the foundation of obeying all the reſt. Its like <hi>Naamans</hi> obeying <hi>Eliſha,</hi> to waſh and be cleane; if <hi>Naaman</hi> had obeyed twenty other charges beſides, what had it booted him? But in this he obeyed all. Doe not then ſullenly abide in thy darkeneſſe and unbeleefe ſtill, becauſe thou art darke, but the rather, abhorre that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious proud heart of thine, which would keep thee in bondage or ſtaggering, and come to Gods promiſe, his light and heat, and that ſhall comfort thee, quicken thee, humble and enlarge thee. As <hi>Naamans</hi> heart grew enlarged to God and the Prophet by his obeying that one charge, ſo that he thought nothing too deare for them, ſo ſhall thine. It will make thee free to obey, not (as he being croſſed) to goe away ſorrowfull; but to lye downe at his feet, ſaying, Speake Lord, for thy ſervant heareth.</p>
               <p>So alſo, be exhorted not to reſt here, but proceed to other obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Doth he deſire thee to ſeal to his Miniſtery by living amiably and ſubjectly in thy marriage, husband and wife, each to other?

When thy Miniſter comes firſt to thee, he findes thee a man of a double heart to God; he ſtrives to draw thee to ſincerity and plainneſſe, he findes thee very ignorant, and ſeekes to breed knowledge of God and thy ſelfe in thee; he findes thee a man of an inconſtant frame and not to be truſted, or proud, ambitious and vaine-glorious, or perhaps contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, covetous, ſtout, wilfull and rebellious, and labours to change thee; thou ſaiſt thou loveſt him:<note place="margin">Jerem.</note> Doth his love then prevaile with thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme theſe vices, or art thou ſtill the ſame man, ſo that he may hope as ſoon to alter the skin of a Black-more, as to alter them? Then I ſay thou lieſt, for thou loveſt him not. As that young man comming to Chriſt, told him many things that he did and had done from his youth: But our Saviour anſwers him, yet one thing remaines, Sell all, and all is well; ſo ſay I to thee, in thy paying of tithes, in thy friendly aſſiſtance and countenance, thou doſt well, but one thing ſtill remaines, obey him, and then it will appeare, that the other are not done to blanch and daub
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:45715:223"/> over thine hypocriſie, but from an heart of love and obedience. I have known ſome looſe profeſſors who have ſought to exceed all other their neighbours in the love of a godly Preacher, and who but they, in their running, riding, aſſiſting of him? They have been as his right hand of truſt and ſervice: But lo, in a ſhort time theſe fellows bewray that which lay ſecret, to wit, an uncleane, covetous, voluptuous heart; and what then? Surely all men ſee evidently that theſe clave to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for their owne baſe ends, and to conceale their vices.</p>
               <p>A ſpeciall watchword to all Miniſters of God to beware how farre they engage themſelves in the love of any profeſſors,<note place="margin">A caveat to Miniſters. See Joh. 2.24.25.

If when all is done, they are ſo ſubtill that we cannot eſpy them, the ſinne ſhall be theirs, wee have ſaved our owne ſoules, and may waſh our hands in innocency, becauſe we have done our duties.</p>
               <p>When all is done, (therefore) this will hold water if we obey:<note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> So ſaith the Apoſtle, Obey them that are ſet over you: And <hi>Paul,</hi> I beare you witneſſe, you obeyed the forme of doctrine delivered unto you: And againe, you received our doctrine, not as the word of man, but as the word of God: Every good hearer ſhould ſay to his Miniſter as <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi> did to <hi>Gehazi,</hi>

Me thought it curbed me from lightneſſe and vanity, from deceit, from ſinning in my tongue, or in any diſguiſement of intemperancy, or couſenage, or covetouſnes, to think, if he now ſaw me, how ſhould I be aſhamed to do thus? Oh! he loves me tenderly &amp; my ſouls welfare, and ſhould I grieve him thus?<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.2.</note> This is indeed to be the Epiſtle of the Miniſter written in our hearts, approving our love unto him to purpoſe. Not that there is not a ſtronger motive then this, to awe and draw people from good to evill, for there is an holy Spirit of annointing which is given to all good ones, which hath ſhed the love of Chriſt into their hearts, and filled them with the length and bredth of it; this ſhould hem in the ſoules of beleevers, (for ſo the word is, 2 Cor. 5.7.) and compell them to watch over themſelves: This muſt bee the chiefe Monitor in the Schoole of Chriſt: If the voice of this great Prophet be not obeyed for it ſelfe, the voice of the ſervant (as he is called, Eſay 50.) will be little worth: For what wonder if they diſobeyed the voice of <hi>Moſes</hi> the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of God, Heb. 2.2.3. who rebelled againſt that holy Spirit which ſet him on worke, and vexed it all thoſe forty yeares, as it is Eſay 63.11. No it muſt be the ſpirit of the Maſter which muſt make his Steward eſteemed: The love of the Lord Jeſus, muſt make the love of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter compulſive, elſe it will prove nothing but ſlaviſh feare, or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void baſe ſhame; as we ſee in many a drunkard, or ſwearer, who for the preſence ſake of a ſinfull man, will (for an houre or two) bite in their qualities, which yet they tremble not to commit in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God all the yeare long. Conclude this point then and ſay, I
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:45715:224"/> pretend love to my Miniſter, how ſhall I demonſtrate it really? As <hi>Cornelius</hi> did, Act. 10. Its ſaid, he fell downe and tooke <hi>Peter</hi> by the feet in token of exceſſive love and reſpect: But what, was this all? No ſurely: But this, that he tells him, They were all ready to hearken to whatſoever the Lord ſaid unto them by him: This was a ſure marke; love and feare make reverence, and thence comes obedience.</p>
               <p>When love is ſolid it workes by feare, and cauſes a loathneſſe to doe any thing which might grieve the Miniſter; it ſits like <hi>Mary</hi> at the feet of the Miniſter ready to obey: And that not onely in ſlight matters to remove ſome ſinne which may be ſpared,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.</note> as <hi>Saul</hi> that killed the leane cattell and the baſer ſort of <hi>Amalek;</hi> but even the belovedſt luſt and moſt pretious vice, even the fat cattell, and the King himſelfe: True love abhorres common evidence, its painfull, it will be ſingular, and aske,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.47. Joh. 21.</note> what ſingular thing doe I to approve my love? When our Saviour would try <hi>Peters</hi> love, he askes him, Loveſt thou me more then theſe? As ſome think he meant of his nets &amp; occupation, as others of his fellow Apoſtles. Both will do well: Love thy Miniſter by obeying more then others, yea love him more then thy nets, thy beloved trade, thy luſts which bring thee in the greateſt gaine, thy ſweet uſury, thy gaming, thy deceit, which others (who love him not) would as ſoone loſe their lives as forgoe: The forfeit of theſe will import ſtrongly that thou loveſt not him for any by reſpect, but as he is a Miniſter of God. I remember a ſtory of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, (one that was reputed as humble as a proud Pope might be) who being told of a baſe fellow that had much abuſed him in a Paſquill; anſwered, I ſuſtaine two perſons, one of a poore Monk, another of Chriſts Vicar, if thou haſt railed upon me as a Monk, I pardon thee, if as Pope, I muſt puniſh thee. So there is no true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt who lookes at himſelfe as a man, but at the honour of him whoſe ſervant he is, and to whom he deſires all the peoples obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſhould be derived. Try therefore whether thy luſts can draw thee ſtronglier then he; if two loadſtones draw both together, the iron will goe to the ſtrongeſt: So let thy love goe to him from thy luſt. Fleire not in his face, nor beare him faire in hand, when as yet thine heart goes another way. Doe nothing behinde his backe, which thou wouldeſt not doe before him: In all thy doubtfull matters conſult with him, let him come within thy boſome, know thy ſecrets, and hide no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from him wherein he can informe thee, for he is for God and Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.20.</note> as a faithfull Embaſſadour for thy good. Doth he tell thee, O my friend, I perceive your zeale quales ſhrewdly in this Laodicean age, you heare oft, but ſleep much at Sermons, you jangle ſo much of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buſineſſe upon the Sabbath, that I feare you meditate little: Or, you are zealous, but you grow not in knowledge, wiſdome, tenderneſſe, to manage your zeal aright from raſhneſſe and cenſoriouſnes: Or, you are noted to be full of words or a buſie body: Or, you are given to flout and jeere when you are in company: Or, you are bold to dally with women: Or, you are too idle in your calling, and runne up and downe needleſly: Or, you faile in compaſſion to the poore, or doe ſmall good with that you have, you are hard and ſore in dealings, or make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of keeping promiſe, in all which reſpects the Goſpel ſuffers, and
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:45715:224"/> the Lord (with your own credit and Miniſtery) lye at the ſtake: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, if you love me, as you profeſſe to doe, amend theſe, I ſay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him in all, and be earneſt with God and him to make thy love effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall herein, that thou maieſt appeare not to love in word, but in deed and truth. And ſo much for this Exhortation.</p>
               <p>And for the Miniſter, one word let me adde.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vſe ult.</hi> Miniſters muſt love only for procuring obedience to the truth.</note> That which in the greene tree is not to be ſuffered, how much leſſe in the dry? If people muſt not equivocate with their Miniſter, much leſſe may he with them. Doe not ſeeke favour with the people, and ſeeme to love them to any other ends, ſave to draw them to obey thy Doctrine. If thou wilt needs ſeem great with them, improve al thine intereſt for God and their good: Seeke not to idolize thy ſelfe in any mans heart and affections for thine own ends, that thou mightſt either magnifie thy perſon above other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, or get the reputation of ſome great perſon (as <hi>Magus</hi> did) or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large thine eſtate and preferments: But in all let it appeare,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.14.</note> that thou ſeekeſt them, not theirs; and as a ſervant of Chriſt thou ſeekeſt to ſet up him, though with thine owne abaſement. As thou uſeſt thy ſelfe, ſo will it appeare in thy courſe what thou aimeſt at; and if once people ſmell what thou ſeekeſt, thou ſhalt both draw flatterers enough, (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meet covers for thy cup) and deterre all that make conſcience from honouring thee from the heart: For why? Under colour of ſerving thy Maſter, thou tradeſt for thy ſelfe, and diſcovereſt thy ſelf to bee a meer Sycophant, not caring which end goes forward, ſo thou canſt worke thine owne ends. Not much unlike thoſe timeſervers, the Princes of <hi>Ioaſh,</hi> who came and did him great homage, but why? To draw his heart from God to Idolls, and their owne purpoſes; and thoſe leaguers in France, in King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth his time, for the aliening of his heart from the Proteſtant Religion, which proved the ruine of them both. But of this in the next Argument.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, here is Conſolation to all ſuch as ſecond their affection to the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>4</label> Miniſter of God, with entire and ſincere obeying his voice.<note place="margin">Comfort.</note> Thou canſt doe little for thy Miniſter perhaps, but this thou doeſt, thou obeyeſt him: Its a ſigne unto thee that thy love is ſincere unto him (and which is better) to the Lord himſelfe, to the meſſage he brings; nay its a ſigne thy heart is in love with the truths of God, his commands, threats and promiſes; It argues thou loveſt all the Miniſters of God without diſſimulation or partiality, (a rate gift, and hardly found, for each man will have his owne <hi>Paul, Cephas</hi> or <hi>Apollo.</hi>) Nay, to conclude,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.4.</note> its a ſigne that there are many graces in thee, ſaith purging thy conſcience, humility and ſelfe-deniall, all ſaving gaces.

And ſo much for this ſecond Argument of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, drawne from his love to the Prophet. Now I come to the Third.</p>
               <p>And that is couched cloſely, but effectually in theſe words, How much more when he ſaith unto thee,<note place="margin">3. Argument. The ſincerity of the Prophet</note> Waſh and be cleane? As if they ſhould ſay, Alas! What ſeekes the Prophet in all this his charging thee to waſh in Jorden? What, doth he expect a reward of thee? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, then he would not ſo effectedly have kept in and refuſed to talke with thee, he would then have ſought thy face as a Prince bringing great gifts, flattered and fawned on thee for his owne vantage: But now behold,<note place="margin">Explication of the ground.</note> he ſimply and ſincerely tells thee Gods meſſage, looking at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe: That which he urges is nakedly this, that for thine owne good thou mightſt waſh and be cleane. If he had ſought from thee ſome great matter for himſelfe, (though no doubt, thou wouldeſt eaſily have yeelded to that alſo, yet) then he might with more colour have beene ſuſpected: But now, ſince he hath no further reach then thy cure and welfare, entirely deſiring thy good, and loath to ſee thee returne home with thy diſeaſe, why ſhouldeſt thou not yeeld to him and waſh? Shall he ſeeme more heartily to wiſh thy happineſſe then thou thine owne? That were to be doubly blindefolded with paſſion, neither to ſee his love, nor to wiſh thine owne good.

And in very deed, it is that argument by which (throughout the Scriptures) the holy Ghoſt pleads audience.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Samuel</hi> being to urge the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to repent and return againe into covenant with God, and to conteſt with them for their Rebellion, beginnes with this argument, Behold here I am, witneſſe againſt me, before the Lord, Whoſe Oxe or Aſſe have I ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?

The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 20.31.23.34. being to preſſe thoſe Elders of Epheſus to tread in his ſteps, and to conceale nothing of Gods truth from his Church, urges his owne patterne, I have coveted no mans ſilver, gold, nor apparell, yea your ſelves know, that theſe hands have miniſtred unto my neceſſities, and to yours who have been with me; and by this rule he bids them proceed, pleading that golden ſpeech of Chriſt: Its a more bleſſed thing to give then receive. The ſame Apoſtle, 2 Cor. 12.14.15.16. being to draw the Corinths to liſten to his charges, cleers himſelfe from all imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſeeking himſelf &amp; inſincerity: This third time am I ready to come unto you, and I will not be burthenſome, for I ſeeke not yours, but you: I will gladly ſpend and be ſpent for you, though the more I love you, the leſſe I am loved; but be it ſo, yet I did not burthen you, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crafty, I taught you by guile. Note how he oppoſes his craft to the falſe Apoſtles, their craft was to catch that they had, but <hi>Pauls</hi> to

Or in preaching freely? I was chargeable to no man: and 2 Cor. 7.2. being to joine iſſue with the maine doctrine of Chriſt, he argues thus, Brethren, receive us, we have wronged no man, corrupted, defrauded no man, <hi>q.d.</hi> you may beleeve us the rather: The like we have in the entrance of this Epiſtle,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.12.</note> For this is our rejoycing, the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in all ſimplicity, and godly ſincerity, and not in fleſhly wiſdome, but in the grace of God we have had our converſation in the world, and more eſpecially towards you, <hi>q.d.</hi> elſe you might ſuſpect us. So in the firſt Epiſtle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.1.2.</note> When I came unto you, I came not with the excellency of ſpeech, or of wiſdome: But my preaching was in the demonſtration of ſpirit, <hi>q.d.</hi> therefore you have cauſe to receive it.

               <p>Other Texts will offer themſelves by occaſion: One thing I will add occaſioned by my Text, and that is, That as inſincere and ſelfe-ſeeking ends are alway ſinfull, ſo even the abridging of our ſelves of ſome of that lawfull liberty (which a Miniſter or other publicke perſon might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe uſe) is meet and requiſite,<note place="margin">Miniſters who will purchaſe intereſt in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, muſt forfeit ſome of their own.</note> ſo oft as we have to deal with weake ones and ſilly novices, who are not yet ſtrong enough to digeſt our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, but rather to ſtumble at us, and ſo turne all our counſell and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to meer unprofitablenes. To covet other mens eſteem or wealth, is ſimply evill: But as the caſe may ſtand, it is not meet to urge the uttermoſt of our due, when thereby our Miniſtery lyes upon hazard: But ſo pretious ought ſoules to be, and the preſerving of the honour of our perſons and labours, (eſpecially ſince there will ever be weake ones and ignorant, till they ſee their folly by wiſer experience) that even ſometimes we muſt remit of our dues, that ſo wee may ſerue into the mindes of men the more perſwaſively: Which I ſpeake not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anull the Miniſters right, or the right of ſucceſſion, when his dues are injuriouſly detained by thoſe that are baſely minded and fraudulent: But according as a wiſe mans judgement would in ſuch caſes think meet for a time to avoid greater perill: And ſo was it in the caſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> and in thoſe primitive times: And not unlike to it was the caſe of <hi>Naaman</hi> here, whom the Prophet durſt not in any wiſe offend, but aiming at the honour and eſteem of God and his worſhip, that it might be kept entire, would not ſo much as come out before, nor after this cure effected, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept either more or leſſe at his hands, though otherwiſe Prophets ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted poore preſents from men, as appeares, 1 Sam. 9.8. being the meanes of their ordinary ſupport allowed them by God. But from Proofes, I come to a few Reaſons.</p>

Partly in reſpect of the nature of it, becauſe nothing doth more reſemble Gods excellency then Pureneſſe &amp; Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: And partly, becauſe uſually nothing doth ſo much hinder and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall Gods glory and ends, then ſeeking our own: look one place or two, in which both theſe are put together, as making to one and the ſame purpoſe.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.16.17.</note> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> preſſing the Jewes to beleeve his Epiſtle, uſeth this argument, Becauſe (ſaith he) we ſpeake without all diſſimulation and cunning deceit: But how doth he prove this? Surely by this reaſon, becauſe he preached no other doctrine then that which had been taught him by his Maſter, We have not followed cunningly deviſed fables, but that of which we our ſelves were ey-witneſſes, for Chriſt had it of the Father, and we had it of him. Marke how he fetcheth the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his writings from the divine authority by which he ſpake. If then Divineneſſe be ſo ſtrong a reaſon to perſwade our ſincerity, much more ought ſincerity to prevaile and perſwade them whom we deale with. And the reaſon is, becauſe many may poſſibly plead truthes as from God, who yet plead them not in a due manner, that is ſincerely, as wee know that many preach Chriſt of envy: But when both goe together, that is, ſincere truth, and truth ſincerely handled, what can be ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full?<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.2.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> puts both together in the place forequoted, We wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not in craftineſſe, but by manifeſtation of truth and the word of God: How?

               <p>Briefly then, the firſt Reaſon ſtands thus, Sincere counſell deſerves acceptance, becauſe it cannot but be from God, and ſo carries with it the force of a divine perſwaſion which muſt needs work more with the conſcience then any thing of our owne, be it never ſo powerfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>2</label> The ſecond argument of the point, That ſincere counſell deſerves acceptance, is from the nature of Sincerity: There is nothing in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it which hath more efficacy. Now that which is in it ſelfe moſt effectuall, ought to winne accordingly ground in the minde of them whom it concernes. This may eaſily appeare by the contrary: Nothing is ſo diſſwaſive as counſell when it appeares to come from falſhood, and mixture of our owne ends with the truth we utter. See it in 1 King. 22. When all thoſe flattering <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts brought in their verdict to <hi>Ahab</hi> very plauſibly, <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> ſmelling their pretence to pleaſe <hi>Ahab,</hi> could not reſt quiet, but asked, is not here a Prophet of the Lord to enquire of? None but a perverted man by his blinding ſelf-love would hearken to them, becauſe he beleeved that which he deſired. Therefore on the contrary, ſincerity muſt needs carry with it the powerfull perſwaſion of all other: Now if ſo, then ought it to take moſt place with men whom it concernes. What did ſo carry the ſilly ignorant multitude in
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:45715:226"/> the darkeneſſe of Popery, after the perſons and devotions of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars, Fryers and Monkes, from the counſel and miniſtery of their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prieſts? Oh the wonderfull opinion of their ſincerity and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of life and doctrine, and the apparant baſeneſſe and rottenneſſe of the Secular Clergy! Not that the one was one whit holier then the other (neither barrell better herring) but ſo it was, that the one lived in their Cells and Cloyſters, wherein all their villany was covered from the ſight of men; they blinded the people by their coorſe fare, apparell, poverty, and counterfeit ſincerity, being double iniquity: the other ſinnes brake out more openly in the ſight of the world, and made them moſt odious: and ſo did the other after the light had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it, for then all men ſaw them ſo much the more vile, by how much they had lurked and lyen hid ſo long under their covert of ſhame. To end the Reaſon. Except men bee mad and beſotted, thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall prevaile moſt with them which are in themſelves moſt effectuall, not thoſe which ſavor of the contrary, to wit, falſhood and diſſimulation.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, ſutable to the nature of ſincerity and falſhood, is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>3</label> of man, to whom ſincerity or falſhood is applyed. Take it thus, We doe by nature marveilouſly diſtaſte all truth, whether it concerne the ſhunning of evill, or the doing of good. But let it but appeare to ſuch perſons that thoſe who perſwade them to the one or from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they doe it for any other ends ſave Gods, they are thereby more ready to catch at ſomewhat which may ſtrengthen them in their naturall oppoſition to good, or inclination to evill: And by this they are ſtrengthened in their courſe. But if this their colour be waſht off, and that it appeare that they are ſincerely counſelled from God, then either it ſecretly drawes the heart to embrace it, or if not, yet it ſtoppes the mouth from all ſhuffling and juſt cavill againſt it. And this is a great matter. So naturally doth ſincerity prevaile with the ſpirit of ſuch as are not ſoked and ſapped in their ſinne, willing to be gulled (nay to gull their owne conſcience) that although it doe not for the preſent convince, yet afterward it prevailes: when the ſeed under the dry clod is moyſtned by ſome ſhowre of affliction, or worke of conſcience; and put caſe it never ſhould, as we ſee <hi>Davids</hi> could not with <hi>Saul</hi> (ſave for the preſent) yet will it (and that juſtly) leave ſuch an one altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable. The iſſue is, therefore they are monſters in kinde whom ſincere counſell perſwades not at all, nay enrages them the more both againſt counſell and counſellor.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and eſpecially, therefore ſuch counſell deſerves to prevaile, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>4</label> becauſe it outſhootes carnall reaſon in her owne bow; they who out of the ſincerity of their ſpirit ſtrive to give counſell to others, doe in a ſort beare downe their carnall reaſon by the practice of ſelfe-deniall. Now what is more ſtrong to beat that downe which moſt reſiſts graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous counſell, then when he that gives counſell reads a lecture to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that which himſelf hath firſt practiſed? True it is, if Gods mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters might bear ſway with men according to their worth, as the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding men to beleeve, repent and be ſaved: What ſhould need to be laid in the ballance with them to enforce obedience? But now the queſtion
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:45715:227"/> is not ſo much touching the things themſelves, or the divine grounds whereupon they infallably reſt, no nor the aſſured profit which they carry to the receivers. Theſe all are undoubted; but alas! That which muſt be looked at, is the diſproportion and uncapableneſſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, blinded with prejudice, foreſtalled by error, ill cuſtome, infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſenſuality: In theſe reſpects, Gods counſells unto fleſh and bloud are as the Camel, or a Cable to a needles eye, ſo that there muſt bee collaterall and by-waies uſed to draw ſuch. Hence came <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> the Lord Jeſus, the Apoſtles of Chriſt, with ſo ſtrange ſpirits, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of gifts, but of ſelf-deniall, of humility, of ſincerity, and ſuch other gifts of attraction and perſwaſion to beleeve thoſe divine truths they urged: All that heard them perceived that they ſought not a Kingdome to themſelves, but made way for God, Truth and Heaven; the diet, the apparell of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the lowlineſſe of Chriſt, that he had not ſo much as a bird or a fox, neſt or hole of the earth to hide himſelf in, the Apoſtles kept no money in their girdles, but had their labour for their paines: this countermined carnall ſenſe in her owne element, and gave unſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able evidence to the counſells, they gave that they were to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe they practiſed what they ſpake, and ſo convinced the very ſenſe of the hearer, and let in (as a needle the thred) the light and life of truth into the ſoule by beating downe that which reſiſted: elſe had it been eaſie for men to reply, Tuſh theſe men ſeek themſelves, but now your mouth is ſtopped.

Enquire of the dayes of old, when men were hunted, perſecuted, martyred for the cauſe of Chriſt: They to whom truth was dearer then their lives, who were farre from ſeeking
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:45715:227"/> great things for themſelves, but carryed their lives in their boſomes to be let out with their life bloud for Chriſt.

That is, if you may not be truſted in the disburſing of a little pelfe and traſh that periſheth, for the good of the body, and releefe of the poore, who will truſt you in the diſpenſing of heavenly treaſure to the comfort of the ſoules of ſuch as need it?

The reaſon is good and holds ſtrong, that baſeneſſe of heart which hinders him from the leſſe by reaſon of a trifle, would aſſuredly much more withdraw him by a greater booty, and try his falſhood. And ſo by contraries. But I will adde a Reaſon or two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Religion agrees well with naturall principles, and admits thoſe conſequences which reaſon allowes. Now there is nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> in nature and reaſon then this, That every whole muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his parts, and every general his particulars: for why? its greater, and therefore includes his leſſer. Againe, we have a rule iſſuing from hence, That which availes in the greater, much more availes in the leſſer. Whether greater in quantity the greater circle includes the leſſe, the perfecteſt figure as a circle, comprehends a leſſe perfect, as a cube; or in quality, as a greater heat containes a leſſer, a greater light (as the
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:45715:234"/> Sun) containes the leſſer, as the Moone: So in other degrees, greater ſtrength containes a leſſe; in numbers, hundred comprehends ſcores; oftneſſe comprehends ſeldomeneſſe; in notions, the more unlikely comprehends the leſſe; the more difficult, the more eaſie; and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may eaſily be drawne from the one to the other to convince any that is guided by ſound reaſon. Therefore it muſt hold in Religion alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>2</label> Secondly, God is the God of order, and his off-ſpring is like him; Religion is an orderly thing, no confuſion. But if men might goe to worke as they liſt, and goe out and in, be off and on, in greater matters conſcionable, in leſſer careleſſe, bound to no rule, where ſhould wee have or finde men? Religion being the ſeed of God, acts and workes the heart to grace or duty by an infallible principle; ſo that who ſo makes conſcience of great things, doth it upon a command of God, and not only for obſervation ſake or baſe reſpects: Now he who is guided by a command, conſiders it according to the extent of it, and if he bee willing in caſes of difficulty to obey, he is much more ready to obey in eaſier and leſſer, becauſe elſe he ſhould juſtly queſtion his ſincerity in the greater. The ſame generall tye lying upon the ſoule in both great and ſmall, the ſoule dares not offend in the ſmall, leſt it ſhould ſeeme to obey the greater for ſome ends of it owne to avoid the ſhame which the neglect of the greater might rather cauſe, then the violation of the ſmaller.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, faithfulneſſe in the greater takes away that barre of falſhood which might hinder the performance of the ſmaller: Perhaps a falſe heart might poſſibly buckle to a greater worke of Piety or Charity, then to a ſmaller, becauſe it ſees more carnall content accruing to it ſelfe by the greater then by the ſmaller. But a ſincere heart that abhorres falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, is carried by another inſtinct, and cares not ſo much what men thinke, as what God thinkes, remembring that ſpeech, Not he who men praiſeth is a true Jew or Chriſtian, but whom God praiſeth. The argument in ſundry reſpects prevailes with a Chriſtian from the leſſer to the greater,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. ult.</note> as well from the greater to the leſſer: When great duties lye upon him to be done, he argues thus, Shall I make conſcience of ſmaller, ſecreter offences, and ſhall I not much more abhor the groſſer? Doe I provide for my owne peace in the ſmaller, ſo that the leaſt gnat makes me ſtraine, and doe I not make much more conſcience of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which would more waſte and weaken my peace? So in good things: Doe I make conſcience of ſmaller duties, as to give an almes, to rule my tongue, or a paſſion wherein God is leſſer honoured; and doe I not much more regard the maine duties of faith, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of my heart and inner man from hypocriſie, in which I ſhould ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him much more? Again, when the queſtion is of leſſer ſinnes avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or duties doing, then it diſputes another way: Have I found the yoke of God light unto me in thoſe things which I feared my baſe heart would never be drawne too, becauſe of their difficulty and danger, and ſhall I draw backe in ſmaller wherein no ſuch hurt or hardneſſe is to be feared? Surely this were to requite God evill for good, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray my lewdneſſe, that I ſeeke ſtarting holes and excuſes to ſhake off the yoke when I ſee the leaſt crevis of liberty to the fleſh afforded; ſo
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:45715:234"/> that I will ſerve God no more then needs muſt, and would ſhift my hands of the greateſt much more, if the neceſſity thereof, and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of others did not compell me.</p>
               <p>So then the point is cleer: He that is faithfull in a greater, will be ſo much more in the leſſer. Howbeit the point muſt be underſtood aright,<note place="margin">Explanation of the point.</note> and according to the naturall meaning and intent of it; we muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore qualifie (Greatneſſe) and (Smalneſſe) in their due meaſure, or elſe the point will not hold.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we muſt qualifie men aright in their opinion, for to ſome men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that may ſeem greateſt, which to another is ſmalleſt, and another may judge that leaſt, which another thinks greateſt: When that young man came to our Saviour and told him, He had kept all the Commands from his youth, our Saviour anſwered him, Goe ſell all. The ſcope of Chriſt was to confute his preſumption, in keeping all by laying open his inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to keepe one, and that leſſer then any of the morall ones. For to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey one command in the manner and due meaſure thereof, is that which never yet fleſh could do: But to ſell all hath beene done by many, who never obeyed one command of the morall Law in his extent and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Now yet marke, this young man tooke it otherwiſe, for hee thought to ſell all to be harder then all the other, in which reſpect our Saviour ſearcht him to the quicke, but in the thing it ſelfe it was not ſo.</p>
               <p>Againe, in this caſe circumſtances prove eſſentialls ſometimes, as of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> time, for at ſome time a man may be fit for a greater, who at another is not fit for a ſmaller: As to give ten pound at his death for religious uſes, who perhaps while hee lived could not ſo well ſpare tenne ſhillings.</p>
               <p>Alſo the preparation of the heart muſt be conſidered: In the generall, <hi>David</hi> may be thought to be readier to pardon <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> then <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the one failing by error, the other ſubſtantially; but he was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the caſe of the one, but naked in the other. Beſides he beheld <hi>Shemei</hi> under a true colour, as ſet on by God to try him; but the other in a falſe, as ſuſpecting that a favorite ſhould be treacherous which was nothing ſo.</p>
               <p>So a generall cuſtome of corrupt nature may faſten greater degree upon a leſſer thing, and a leſſer upon a greater. Act. 14. Thoſe people <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of Lycaonia might have thought it a greater humility for men to abaſe themſelves to men, then to God: But Idolatry and corrupt cuſtome cauſed even their proud hearts to proffer worſhip to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> (as agreeing with a fleſhly heart) rather then God himſelf, whom when they were urged to worſhip, they tooke up ſtones to kill the Apoſtles. And endleſſe it were to ſhew the variety of reſpects wherein this rule may faile: But this I ſay, if the true natures of things and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men about them, be reconciled, taking things in their due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent without error, then the point alway holds true, He that is faithfull in the greater, is ſo much more in the ſmaller. For why? A Chriſtian is acted by ſuch a ſpirit as teaches him to doe all things with ſincerity, equality and proportion, both great and ſmall, one and another, leſt if any flaw appeare, it ſhould breed a diſproportion in the eye of God, or of man, and cauſe an ey-ſore to both: As when wee ſee a comely face
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:45715:235"/> joyned to a crooked body, or a deformed and crooked back and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to a good countenance, preſently there appeares an indignation in us at the eye-ſore.</p>

I diſcourage none, nor cenſure any particular perſons for their almes, theſe are no dayes for it, I rather would ſpeake two words to further, then one to hinder; yet we know ſuch a diſeaſe there is,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10.1.</note> and who would ſpoile a whole box of ointment for one dead fly; doe both, ſcatter in private ſome handfulls, as well as powre out whole buſhells, and then the ſuſpition is taken away. Once I remember a man who long profferd his kindeneſſe to a Colledge, but ſtill left his gift ſealed up till death, then he would give all, but before nothing: Why? Alas! after death there is no pleaſure, which before there is, and men are willing to part with their wealth, when pleaſure in it, and power of it are gone. I tax none who give after death, but deſire to rectifie them; (for ability permitting) who ſhould not rather chuſe (in part at leaſt) to be his owne executor then to leave it to ſtrangers, not knowing what it may come to.</p>

               <p>Secondly, this diſorder may ariſe from terror and feare of horrible impieties, horror of the penalty, unnaturalneſſe of the fact, and ſuch like bits and bridles which God puts into the mouthes of men, which if they were abſent, the rule would ſoone prove true; the committer of the greater, would make no bones of the ſmaller. Eye for eye, tooth fortooth, skin for skin, and all that he hath, will a man give for his life: but ſmaller things are not ſo perilous.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this may iſſue from vain-glory, when a man thinks he ſhall have a deeper eſteeme among men for ſome greater worke which in a leſſer would vaniſh, of which before: Or pride, when a baſe heart thinks ſmaller duties to be under him, and not equall to his great ſtomacke to undertake; though perhaps ſome great ones he will ſtoope unto, as more ſuting to his greatneſſe. We have a Proverb, Eagles catch no flies. So the ſpirits of great ones thinke that ſmall matters are a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to them, they will not foule their fingers with them.

But to goe to our Doctrine.

And to confeſſe the truth, it were to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that we Proteſtants diſcovered our mortification in greater and more outward ſelfe-deniall then we doe: But as for them, this I ſay, if they excell us ſo much in the greater, how comes it to paſſe that they faile ſo much in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things he cares not for, but to walke humbly with him, and to do juſtly, and ſhew mercy: Therefore it is evident, they &amp; theſe fail in their account, and ſet a greater marke upon their devotion then God doth, and therefore are lyars: If thoſe things which they alledge were grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, ſurely they who are ſo forward in them would not be behinde hand in ſuch as they account the ſmaller.<note place="margin">Eſay 66.2:</note> They would ſay of themſelves when all is done, our righteouſneſſe is as a menſtrous clout, and count themſelves (for ought is in them to merit) as Publicans and vileſt ones, unprofitable ſervants, whereas their building within riſes up to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter height of ſelf-confidence by their outward caſtings downe; for they thinke that not onely they may merit for themſelves, but for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and more then fulfill the Law, and ſo by equalling themſelves to Chriſt, they overthrow the ſole ſoveraignty of his ſatisfaction and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.

               <p>To apply this: Let us learne hence to ſumme up the mercies of God vouchſafed us already, and let us weigh them in due ballance: If wee have ſeene him feed ſeven thouſand with a few loaves,<note place="margin">Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to us in the maine, muſt make us truſt him in the ſmaller things.</note> doe we diſtruſt him to feed twelve Diſciples? Do we finde that he hath beſtowed upon us the maine, let us beware of diſtruſting him in the leſſer? For he holds this rule much more ſurely then we: We will truſt a friend that hath lent us an hundred pound, for the lending us twenty ſhillings, and ſhall we diſtruſt God? He that hath made our bodies and breathed in our ſoules, will he deny us food and raiment? Is not the belly better then meat, and the body then cloathing? Whence is then this our diſtruſt? If he hath given us his Sonne,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.25.</note> will he not with him much more give us other things? leſſer matters? If he have made us a feaſt in the mountaines, will he not much more give us ordinary food in the valleyes? Had it not beene a baſe diſtruſt in them that came into Canaan, to thinke that God might ſuffer them to ſtarve in the midſt of a land flowing with milke and hony, having before by a miracle nouriſhed them with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, quales, and the following rocke of water, in the deſert? Doth the Lord urge us ſinfull wretches by a Law, which himſelfe will not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve? If we be faithfull in the greater treaſure, will he truſt us in the leſſer, and will not we truſt him? Let us boldly urge the argument up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him by faith, and we ſhall prevaile,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.32.</note> he himſelfe hath put it into our mouth: If it become weake,<note place="margin">Read a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all place in Math. 16.8.9.</note> its becauſe we have made it ſo by our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe, and let it fall to the earth. We deceive our ſelves in the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall promiſe, and then accuſe him that he keeps not touch with us in the leſſer: But if we would deale ſubſtantially in matters of weight, we ſhould finde that other leſſer things would follow our hand with eaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the great ſhip of the main promiſe would carry all our ſmaller veſſells of our ſecondary ſupplies after it without our rowing or ſtrife. But oh how baſely doe we deale herein with God and our ſelves? We dare beleeve that God will ſave our ſoules, but whether he will keep us from poverty or no, or bring us out of debt, or enable us to maintaine our charge we cannot tell, we have not ſo cleer a word for that (we ſay) as for the other. Nay, rather we yeeld more to ſenſe and carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in this, then in the other; or elſe make our ſelves thinke we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the former better then indeed we doe. Alas! if the greateſt were beleeved, it were eaſie to caſt anchor upon the other: If the mountaine be given us, ſhall a molehill be denied us? No, but we are pinched more with unbeleefe in the leſſer, then the greater; if we had the like pinch of heart about the chiefe point of favour and pardon, would it not (thinke we) daſh the other, and make it nothing?

               <p>How comes it to paſſe then, that thoſe who have taſted how ſweet the Lord hath beene in eaſing us of a burthen which wee never lookt to be rid of, that we diſtruſt him for faith in petty caſes?

<pb n="437" facs="tcp:45715:238"/> and caution. He that in a ſmaller office of the Towne hath been ſlacke and backed the bad, truſt him in no greater; let him have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe with ſhame. The like I might ſay in other caſes. He that in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage hath lived badly with one wife, let him not have thy voice for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother till thou ſee a change: Put not thy child to be a ſervant to him or her, who by their ill government of former ſervants is diſabled in in their credit. Hee that cannot rule his owne children well, commit not the education of thine to him, either living or dying, for feare of unfaithfulneſſe. And ſo much for this Verſe, this Doctrine, and Lecture.</p>

                  <hi>viz.</hi> the iſſue of the counſell of the Prophet and of the Servants: That is the cure of <hi>Naaman</hi> both bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ghoſtly. A very ſweet concluſion of ſo ſad a diſtemper as paſſed betweene, and ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as every one that would wiſh it a good end, could not have wiſht it better then it fell out. In the which that wee may ſteere our courſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in the beginning, let us doe with this as wee did with the former generalls, that is analyſe it into the naturall branches ariſing from it. The Verſe in generall containes the obedience of <hi>Naaman</hi> to the charge of the Prophet,<note place="margin">Explication and Analyſe of this fourth generall.</note> and it hath two parts, to wit, the act of his obeying: Or the conſequents thence following: In the former we have three things: Firſt, the time when. [Then he went] <hi>viz.</hi> being by the counſell of the ſervants, and the perſwaſion of Gods Spirit brought downe from his former reſolution, and mollified to an humble ſpirit of obeying: [Then he went.] The Prophets meſſage enraged him. But the Servants counſel overpowres him. We may ſay of it as <hi>Deborah</hi> in another caſe ſaid to <hi>Barak:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Judg. 4.</note> Thou ſhalt not have the honour of the victory, but a woman. So the Prophet muſt not have the credit of the conqueſt, but the poore Servants. The ſecond is the act it ſelfe, noting wherein the worke of faith conſiſts, even in the obedience of the ſoule to a word of command and promiſe: He went and waſhed ſeven times. The third is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his obedience, it was full as large, and no more then the word
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:45715:239"/> of charge and promiſe imported, for he did according to the ſaying of the man of God: The ſenſe of it is, he went not caſually or for his own ends, or by compulſion, becauſe they would needs force him to it, but of his owne accord by the leading of the word. The ſecond generall is the conſequents hereof; and they are firſt or remote: The firſt and chiefe is the iſſue of his obedience, partly expreſſed and partly implyed; expreſſed at large, as if the holy Ghoſt would be as full in laying down the iſſue on Gods part, as he had done the obedience of the part on <hi>Naaman:</hi> His fleſh became as a childs, cleere and contrary to the ſcurvy and unſightly fleſh of a leper, and he was cleane, as if hee ſhould ſay, God was not wanting in his performance to the uttermoſt, nay did more then he promiſed, caſt in the cure of his ſoule, as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verplus to the cure of his body. The other is ſecret and yet manifeſt enough; for now the Text would give us to underſtand, That all his old wrath and conceits were vaniſht, all was now on the ſuddaine chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: Jorden was an happy water to him, (but rather his faith) for that ſcoured away all his diſtempers at once, never to be heard of any more. This for the analyſe of this Verſe. Other ſecond conſequents there are, not belonging to my purpoſe and ſcope in handling of this ſtory, and they lye in the three verſes after.</p>
               <p>We come to the firſt of theſe, which (as I noted) the coherence of the verſe with the former, gives us to conceive of. To wit, that now at laſt ſeaſonably, (even as apples of gold and pictures of ſilver) comes in a calme after a great and long ſtorme. Who loves not to heare of reſt after labour, and joy after heavineſſe? Oh its as dew to the graſſe, and as drinke to the thirſty! <hi>Naaman</hi> was one whom God had a purpoſe to honour his grace upon at laſt; and therefore lo, ſo muſt it prove, though it were long firſt, even after many defeats and conflicts, yet he obeyes the Prophet, and is healed of his leproſie.</p>
               <p>The point is, God hath an appointed and ſet time for all his,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctrine.</hi> God hath a time of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing the worke of grace in his Elect.</note> wherein after all their feares and diſtempers, he will vouchſafe them an happy iſſue at the laſt. No corruption within them, no difficulty in the worke of faith, no malice of Divell, no diſcouragements by others, nor the longſome delayes of grace and mercy, ſhall finally deprive them of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and comfort: But at the time appointed, God ſhall bring forth judgement unto victory, and in the meane ſeaſon ſupport the ſoule from utter ſinking under her burthen.<note place="margin">Pſal. 97.11.</note> There is light ſowne for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, though it lye long in the moulds by reaſon of cold ſnuffes of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet a ſweet day at laſt will come, and a ſunſhine to fetch it up. Proofes of Scripture are ſo many that I muſt cull out ſome few.<note place="margin">Heb. 4.9.</note> That in the Hebrewes agrees well with this in the generall, There is then a reſt for the people of God, a Sabbath of grace, of pardon and peace, after many unlikelihoods, and a Sabbath of glory after all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats and conflicts here. That which <hi>Elizabeth</hi> tells <hi>Mary,</hi> Luke 1. is true of all whom God hath by his Spirit conceived in the wombe of the Church, there ſhall be given a performance to them of all the things which are promiſed from the Lord. A time there is for all things, as of toile, feare, doubts, reſiſtance, ſo of eaſe, reſt, reſolution and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the word:<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1.2.</note> They ſhall be as glad of it as ever they were averſe
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:45715:240"/> and aloofe from it. God creates the fruit of the lips, peace to them not onely who are neere, and faire for it, but far off, and unlike to ſpeed of it.<note place="margin">Eſay 57.17. Heb 10.37. Mal. 3. Hoſ. 12.</note> He who commeth will come and not tarry, and bring healing in his wings. He will accompliſh the warfare of his Sion, and be as one that takes off the yoke from the jawes, and lay meat unto them. A moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine text is that of <hi>Eſay;</hi> I ſaw his concupiſence, and I will heale him: for why? He will not be angry nor contend for ever; for then ſhould fleſh faile, and the ſoules which he hath made. The like where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to is that in his 54. Chap. For a moment in wrath I ſmote him, I hid my ſelfe and was angry for a while,<note place="margin">Eſay 54.7.</note> for a ſhort time: But with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting compaſſions will I returne to him, ſaith the the Lord thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. Marke, The dayes of peace ſhall not be as the time of trouble, thats but an houre of darkeneſſe, but this a day of light: And ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the tribulation with a ſettled welfare.<note place="margin">Job ult.</note> As <hi>Iob</hi> when God turned his captivity, enjoyed all comforts with continuance: yea the Lord addes, This is no caſuall thing but certaine: It is as the flood of <hi>Noah,</hi> which the Lord ſware ſhould no more deſtroy the earth, and his covenant is as the Rainbow which when we ſee, we reſolve there ſhall be no more ſuch deluge.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> Reaſons alſo are many. Not onely from Gods ſecret purpoſe who knowes his owne, and therefore its impoſſible for any chaines to hold them from him: They muſt one day feele the power of that election, to call them, to ſave them, which firſt preordained them to grace: But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from the courſe of Gods revealed will and diſpenſation. For that grace which firſt prevents them, afterward aſſiſts and followes them, till at laſt it perfect the worke of faith in them. Both the former I noted in this preſent example; God prevented him by the meſſage of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ableneſſe to heale him by the Damſels meanes, and brings him to the Prophet, though after much error. The ſame God aſſiſted him there, and raiſed up his ſervants to be his Counſellors, though much pudder came betweene. And now at laſt, when the diſeaſe was ripe, he lets out the impoſtume, overthrowes Selfe and carnall reaſon, melts and perſwades his heart, ſo that, although he was more like to have gone from Jorden in a rage, yet now he goes and waſhes himſelfe in it, and recovers. And thus deales the Lord with us, if he have ſavingly prevented, graciouſly aſſiſted, he will powerfully finiſh his worke, elſe ſhould his power be queſtioned, and men might ſay of him, as they do of men who have laid a platform of a great building and begun the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of it,<note place="margin">Luke 14.39.30.</note> but cannot finiſh. Now this were repugnant to the glory of his grace, and the power of his might, unto which nothing (be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo unlikely) is impoſſible.<note place="margin">Luke 1.</note>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>2</label> The ſecond Reaſon may be taken from the abſurdity and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which muſt follow, if this were otherwiſe. This I toucht out of Eſay 57.16. before, and God himſelf makes it a reaſon teaching us to alledge it. If it could be otherwiſe, then it were poſſible that the moſt excellent nature of God, wherein he exceeds all his other attributes, might be queſtioned: I ſay, then might that compaſſion and mercy in God receive a great foile and reproach: Then ſhould God ſeeme to take from man his righteouſneſſe, which he is farre from, Lam. 3.35.
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:45715:240"/> To rejoice in the miſery of the creature, then ſhould he loſe his name and honour with his people, and not attaine his owne ends, but faile of his purpoſe: Then ſhould the art of God in the way of converſion, bee fruſtrate and prove uneffectuall, as not being grounded upon certaine foundations; then ſhould his promiſes incur the blur of unfaithfulneſſe, and in a word, the ſoule ſhould become as one in a wood, wandring and wildring it ſelfe untill at the laſt it lye downe in her owne ſorrow and confuſion, utterly deſolate and deſperate, which is the eſtate of hypocrites and ſelfe-deceivers, Eſay 50. ult. and ſo God ſhould put no difference between a poor humbled ſoul mourning for him, and one that compaſſes himſelfe with his own ſparkles. All theſe being of infinite abſurdity, and ill conſequcnce, it muſt needs bee that God will not bee angry, nor contend for ever, but finde a time, an accepted ſeaſon, in which he will eaſe the heavy heart of her diſtempers, and ſet her at liberty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Lord hath the ſpirit of man, and the paſſages and waies <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>3</label> thereof in his owne hand, to ſway, draw, alter &amp; turn it as he pleaſes. He formed the ſpirit firſt of his owne breath, knows how it defiled it ſelf, underſtands the wofull inability of it to heale it ſelfe, ſees and beholds the ſecret windings and turnings of it, how it wraps it ſelfe into end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe errors and weariſome doubtings, he permits all theſe in wiſdome, and when he ſees his fitteſt time, he can turne the courſe and ſtreame of the ſpirit his owne way, though the rebellion, croſſeneſſe, feares and ſtaggerings thereof be never ſo perplexed. There is an abſolute ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of God over the will and conſcience of man, that when hee pleaſe he can do with it as men do with rivers of waters,<note place="margin">Proverb.</note> which though naturally they runne downeward, yet by art and skill are recalled, and derived to ſuch uſes as beſt ſerve to the benefit of the owners; ſo that the queſtion is not whether the heart would of it ſelfe encline, but whether God enclines it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the power of the Spirit is ſuch, that it blowes at it owne <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>4</label> pleaſure, and is of a moſt perfect freedome to blow where, when, how farre it ſelfe will, and is not in the power of any Divell, enemy, man himſelfe to croſſe it. God hath the winde of perſwaſion in his owne hand, and he holds the winde in his fiſt. All perſwaſions, arguments and motives doe ſo farre prevaile, or not prevaile with the ſpirit of man as the Spirit it ſelfe pleaſes to ſet them on: When he will overrule the Spirit, a little motive, a word ſpeaking ſhall effect it; when he will ſtop the power of it, nothing ſhall prevaile.<note place="margin">Luke 5.3.7.</note> As <hi>Peters</hi> nets lay by when the ſeaſon was, ſo when the time of catching came, all the fiſh came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and were encloſed under it. So the counſells of the beſt, wiſeſt, ſtrongeſt muſt lye by as ineffectuall, when God is abſent; the heart lies as a ſtone frozen into ice: no axes, mattocks, ſtrife of man ſhall break it: But when his heart is enclining to man, and meanes him good, then ſhall the Spirit lye in another coaſt, and ſuddenly thaw and melt the ice of the ſoule, and diſſolve thoſe ſtrong chaines which bound it before, and made it paſt mans skill to pierce it; ſo that as before nothing could ſoften it, ſo now nothing ſhall harden it. Now then marke, If this power be in the Spirit of grace, it muſt needs ſerve for ſomewhat,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:45715:241"/> it is not needleſſe: Therefore it muſt ſerve to this end, to rid captives of their chaines, to ſpeake a word in ſeaſon to a ſoule that is weary, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the ſeed of life, and the promiſe into the poore and fatherleſſe ſpirit, and there to enter, open, and enlarge the ſoule ſo farre, that as it had no power to apply, to receive or embrace any light or hope, now it may be as the eternall gate opened by the eternall Spirit, who hath the key of <hi>David,</hi> and have no power to ſhut it ſelfe any more, nor to reſiſt the Spirits power and perſwaſion.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>5</label> The fifth Reaſon is taken from the ſcope which mercy propounds to herſelfe in the turning the ſoule to God. Even the glory of it own ſelfe, and that nothing may ſhare with it ſelfe in this great worke of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powring the ſoule. As ſhe onely hath thoſe weights in her hand which can over weigh the baſe and backward heart, ſo ſhe will doe it, when the ſoule hath ſtruggled and tyred her ſelfe in her owne way, hoping by her owne skill to effect it. Then can mercy onely ſave the ſoule, and remove the falſe principle which ſhe found in the ſoule to croſſe it, even when the ſoule ſeemed to be moſt earneſt in ſeeking it. The Lord ſeeks more to honour himſelfe above the ſoule, then to ſhew it mercy onely for the private good thereof; and when he findes that the ſoule herſelfe can make no work of it, is paſt hope in herſelfe, ſees moſt baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in herſelfe, then is his fitteſt ſeaſon to worke for his owne name, and then none ſhall ſhare with him in that point whereof he is ſo jealous, that is his glory.<note place="margin">Eſay 63.4.</note> Eſay 42.5. There is a ſpeciall text of worth for this point, which I wiſh all to obſerve. Eſay 57.17. I was angry with him, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart: But I have ſeene his wayes, and will heale him, and reſtore comfort, and create peace. What? While he goes on in his frowardneſſe, kicks againſt the pricks, and hath no diſpoſition in him to convert? Surely no: (for all the work of Selfe is but the frowardneſſe of a man with himſelf, becauſe he cannot have his will of God.) But then will God heale, that man may be ſet on ground, and bee convinced of his owne impotency; for no reaſon can be given why at laſt the Lord ſhould ſo overrule him, ſave meer mercy to one in miſery, except any will ſay, that a froward heart can merit any mercy. So then, the entire glory of the grace of mercy cauſes the Lord at laſt to finiſh the worke hee hath begunne; that both the Alpha and Omega may be his, both warpe and woofe from him. Thus much for Reaſons. Now I proceed to ſome Queſtions.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Three Queſtions.</note>For upon that I have ſaid, ſundry may be made: Eſpecially theſe three. Firſt, wherein doth appeare, that a ſoule in the way of grace, and under the condition of it, may yet a long time lie under ſuch diſtempers ere it come to apply the promiſe; this may ariſe from the preſent caſe of <hi>Naaman,</hi> of whom the Doctrine ſaith, that the Lord now found a time of grace for him, though it were long firſt: ſome therefore may deſire to ſee it proved, that it may be long firſt, wondring that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls not the ſoule as ſoone as ſhee is under the condition of it. The ſecond queſtion may bee, why the Lord ſhould permit ſuch delayes and longſome ſtaggering, ſince that it may ſeeme it were better if it were ſpeedy, and put out of doubt at firſt. Thirdly, it is asked, by what markes it may appeare to a poore ſoule that the Lord intends
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:45715:241"/> to finiſh his worke, and to ſet her out of her old feares and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
               <p>To anſwer the firſt of theſe, this I ſay, experience proves it, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is not finiſht in many a ſoule (which yet may be under a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>1</label> of it) as ſoone as begunne:<note place="margin">Why converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not perfected all at once?</note> But many things befall one in ſuch an eſtate, (I ſay not alway but oftentimes) which buffet and baske it ſhrewdly, put it into ſad demurres, feares and ſuſpitions, that all will not prove well at laſt, that ſhe hath begunne at the wrong end, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not knowing what to make of it ſelfe, ſits in aſhes and heavineſſe a long time till God bring healing to her.</p>
               <p>To mention ſome of theſe out of the experience of moſt mens ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary complaints: one may be this: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>

Sithence all hope of a poſſible remedy is taken from them.</p>
               <p>A ſecond ſort there are, who for the preſent doe not put difference <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> betwixt the condition and the performance: And therefore comparing their eſtate only with that which formerly they lay in ere they felt their ſins to pinch them; &amp; feeling now ſome hope by the promiſe, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with that, as affording them ſome diſtaſte of ſin, and ſome touches of conſcience, ſome flaſhes of deſire; alſo they feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves loth to loſe their good affections bred in them, as ſorrow and zeale, and hope of growing better, and therefore none can diſſwade them from hearing, and prayer, and ordinances, becauſe they feele theſe to nouriſh affection in them; and thus their warmth tickles their hearts, and hereby (through ſelf-love and eaſe) they are held by the heele, that they ſet downe their ſtaffe, making a damme to ſtop their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious luſts from breaking in upon them, and beleeving that the meer abſence thereof, or reſtraint of their violence is a ſigne of true grace, though they goe no further. And were it not that their damme brake out often upon them, and their corruptions betraid them to themſelves, and their affections forſooke them, and left them to be dead and unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury, as before at the worſt; doubtleſſe they would wanze away as
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:45715:242"/> hypocrites, and lye downe in ſorrow: onely the Lord will not ſuffer his to periſh in this error, but having manifeſted it, makes them turne a new leafe, and breake off their falſe confidence. But in the meane time, who wonders that they attaine no ſettling? For alas! Can their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, duties, affections or ſervices, take away the guilt of an ill conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and give them any ſound bottome? No, doubtleſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, others who are ſet to a ſounder purpoſe, yet oftentimes are ſo confounded in themſelves, that they forget what God hath done for them; becauſe that grace of faith (which they covet) is abſent, this ſo diſquiets and perplexes their ſpirit, that they unthankfully forget what God hath done for them, nay they flatly, but falſely, affirme, that God did never any thing for them at all. They are ſo hooded by the Divell, that whereas they heare the Lord will not forſake his owne worke, but perfect it: They will not confeſſe that ever he wrought any at all in them: They that thinke ſo of them (they ſay) are deceived; for their hearts are hardned, ſenſeleſſe, careleſſe, empty of ſorrow and deſire, and meanes uſing: They never heard (ſay they) otherwiſe then as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of hearers, they were as good never have heard: Whereas it is moſt evident, that the word both of Law and Goſpel have wrought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſweet preparations in them, if they had power to ſee them, ſave that a deep diſcontent of heart hath poſſeſſed them for the want of that they would have, but are not wiſely guided from extremities, ſuch as ſelfe-love may ſoon poiſon them withal. So that as it is with a man who goes upon an hill, over againſt which there is another in their eye, that the vally lying betweene is quite hidden from them: So is it with theſe, till the Lord reſtore the ſight of it againe. But in the meane time wanting the ſenſe of what God hath wrought already, how can they gather hope that God will perfect it?</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> A fourth ſort retaine the memory of that which is already wrought in them by the word: But their let is, that when once they move for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the promiſe, to faſten upon that, they feele ſuch a marvellous cold qualme come over their ſpirit, that they feare they ſhall never reach it. They think it ſo divine, ſo ſpirituall a thing, they ſee the grace thereof, and the gaine ſo admirable, ſo above them, ſo beyond them, that they thinke they ſhall never compaſſe, it were too good for them to enjoy, it belongs to other gates perſons then they: The Lord hath ſomewhat elſe to doe with his Chriſt then to beſtow it upon ſuch: It belongs to ſome few choice ones, and peculiar folke, not to them; they that can reach it may have it: But as for them they deem it (if not a thing impoſſible to come by) yet exceeding unlikely, a thouſand to one, and very difficult howſoever, ſo that perhaps they may ſpend all their time and paines about it, and yet come ſhort too at laſt; therefore they were as good ſpare their labour as ſpend it in vaine. Thus as ſome thinke heaven eaſie, and they looke to be one, though there were but three ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. So others are on the other ſide ſo ſlaviſh that they dare not looke at it. And thus they would abide, if the Lord by degrees caſt not out this bondage: which while it abides, who wonders that they be far from this proſperity?</p>
               <p>

<pb n="445" facs="tcp:45715:242"/> prevailing in them, abaſing them, and making them ſtinke in their owne noſtrills, ſo that although God have begunne to worke in them, yet ſo long as the ſtinch of their luſts, their ignorance, unprofitableneſſe, hypocriſie, inconſtancy, pride, earthly hearts abides in them, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyes them, they cannot thinke the promiſe concernes them. Oh! if they could finde themſelves rid of theſe, they ſhould have hope, elſe none.</p>
               <p>Others caſt their thoughts afarre off, and thinke that faith carries with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> it the implied condition of ſuch a change for time to come as they ſhall never attaine too. For (ſay theſe) beleevers muſt be holy and cleane; whereas we carry ſuch baſe luſts about us, hearts ſo hardned with ſins, that we cannot repent, it were death to us to forgoe ſome beloved e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills, or to keep within a compaſſe of an holy courſe for any time. As good tye a Tygre to a rope and make him to plow the furrowes, as their wilde hearts to any duty and good behaviour. And when they are told that faith will purge their hearts, and they muſt not foreſtall God, then they ſay, though they ſhould repent, yet they ſhould never perſevere: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they dye, the Divell (who owes them a miſchiefe) will ſurely pay it them; one temptation or other will foile and betray them, ſo that ere they die they ſhal revolt moſt fouly, and fall away like <hi>Demas</hi> &amp; <hi>Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi> and ſo goe to their grave with miſery, without returning to God, and beſides bring ſuch a ſtaine upon the Goſpel as will never bee worne out.</p>
               <p>There are others diſcouraged by the long ſpace of time ſince they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> came to ſee themſelves under the condition of grace, as to be loſt, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, &amp;c. and yet they come not to any ſound ſettling upon the promiſe; if God (they ſay) meant to ſave them at all, he would have ſaved them long ere now, for they were once farre more tender then now they are; they were at firſt onely guilty of ſinnes againſt the Law, but now they have added ſinnes againſt the Goſpel alſo, as it were drunkenneſſe to thirſt, yea they are hardned, ſapped, and paſt feeling: And moreover they ſee many others, who beganne farre later then they, yet are got before them, as in other gifts and graces, ſo in faith, and inſight into the myſtery of Chriſt, in which they grow not, but notwithſtanding all meanes, abide ſo ſilly, ſo ſimple, ſo ignorant and uncapable, that there is little or no probability of being better. They feele little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence neither (they ſay) in their courſe, but alway in darkeneſſe, ſad feares, going on and on, but gaining no ground, nor growing more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the hope of beleeving; and therefore they conclude that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to Gods number, they are not (ſurely) choſen of God, and therefore they may will and runne long enough, but they ſhall not finde mercy.

               <p>Another ſort by theſe and the like diſtempers, wax ſullen, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> with melancholy and mopiſhneſſe, and grow therein ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and that they will heare no counſell; they know, they ſay, what their deſtiny is, therefore let no body trouble himſelfe about them: As it is and hath beene, ſo it will be with them ſtill: They know as
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:45715:243"/> much as any Miniſter can teach them: They will not bee brought ſo much as to conſent that there is any better eſtate then they live in, neither doe they thinke that any can have any more aſſurance then themſelves, if they ſee any Chriſtians merier then themſelves, they preſently judge them to be preſumptuous hypocrites, and condemne them. Others do not ſo much cenſure others as themſelves; and grow conceited againſt the meanes, will not be perſwaded to heare or pray, becauſe they doe but encreaſe their damnation; nay (but for neceſſity of nature) they would not eat their meat, nor drinke when they are athirſt, nor goe to any, nor ſuffer any to come at them, neither aske, nor take counſell, for they ſay, theſe things belong to them whoſe they are: But they are none of Chriſts, and therefore have no right unto them. And yet even many of theſe (ſetting aſide the malice of Satan, holding them under with this melancholy of body, or conceit of minde, or both) have given good ſignes of a loaden, broken and deſirous heart.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> To draw to an end, the moſt ſad hindrance of all is, that the beauty of the promiſe, the good things of God given to his are not ſeene into by them: They have not yet met with the ſpirit of light and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſomewhat or other hath dazled it, either their confidence that it ſhall be well with them, or their neglect of meanes, or their uſing them in a ſcanty, ſlacke and formall manner; or their ſubtilty, cloſeneſſe, ſlyneſſe, loathneſſe to part with their pleaſures; or ſome bitter roote of earthlineſſe, which dampes the eſteeme of the Lord Jeſus; they cannot be gaſtered from the creature, it is ſo naturall, ſo rooted in them; or ſome baſe thing or other they will nouriſh (as ſugar under the tongue) and hope to reconcile it with Chriſt, ſo that both may goe together, loth they are that onely bare and naked Chriſt ſhould beare ſway, and come into a naked houſe: or elſe I ſay, the true, kindly and cleere beauty of that which the promiſe preſenteth to a ſoule under a condition, is by ſome meanes hidden from them, as by error, and miſconceiving what faith is, by giddineſſe, by forgetfulneſſe, by fooliſh intermedling with many things,<note place="margin">Luke 11.</note> one thing being neceſſary; by little meditation, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pondering, and incorporating the word into their hearts; by ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at the very point in hand, thinking that ſeeing good onely can and in time will releeve the ſoule; therefore let all goe, caſt all upon God, and be lazy and ſecure.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> But one more, I will adde of moſt uſuall error to many, eſpecially ſuch as are ungrounded, and that is in the putting no difference between Doctrines and Truths handled in the courſe of their hearing. As it is a ſad error of ſome men, that ſo they preach, it skills not what nor how: They little attend the eſtates, periods and degrees of their people, ſo the people are like them; ſo they heare the truth, they little minde what truths doe moſt concerne them,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.7.</note> and ſo alway are hearing, but never come to knowledge. Why? They are fooliſh and undiſcerning. All is fiſh which comes to the net, and they embrace alike one and other; whereas (although all be good) yet it concernes them to looke out ſuch as might fit their needs, and further them in the worke they aime at. Tell a woman whoſe fruit is come to the birth of this tale and that, aske her what linnen ſhe hath, or what meat ſhe will eat; doth ſhe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:45715:243"/> ſuch queſtions? Are they not tedious? Doth ſhe not aime at one thing, that is, how ſhe may get ſtrength to bring forth? So ſhould an hearer that ſeekes the fruit of his labour, not while himſelfe with every truth leſſe concerning for the preſent, but hearkning after ſuch as may anſwer his doubts, cleere his objections, reveale that which he moſt wants, and which ſpeakes moſt directly to his heart. As for pleaſing himſelfe in being in the element of any truth whereof he ſees no uſe, it is irkeſome to a wiſe heart, although he reverence all. And theſe may ſerve for a taſte of many more lets, (which differ as men differ) and for anſwer to the firſt queſtion.</p>

                  </label> for many cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes God permits it. To ſumme them up breefly. One is,<note place="margin">1. Cauſe.</note> becauſe the Lord herein lookes at ſome groſſe ſins which ruled and reigned in the former part of mens life and in youth, which are as iron moles, and will hardly be worne out of the fleſh, being bred in the bone, ſave by tozing and ſearching the heart throughly. Secondly, that he might breed ſome reſtraint in youth, and curbe them from ſuch offences as after muſt coſt a great deale of purging, plowing and harrowing, ere the ſoule will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foard good mould for the word. For ſure it is, the more rebellion the Lord meets with, the more irons he loades the ſoule with, Eſay 28. Thirdly, that he might exerciſe each ſoule in finding out her owne ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall let, and not goe to worke in a fulſome generalneſſe. Fourthly, to breed in the ſoule a ſolemne and ſad thought concerning the way of God, and roote out that giddineſſe and vanity which puffes up the ſoule in a vaine preſumption and eaſe. Fifthly, to occupy the minde of the Miniſter in right and carefull dividing the word, and ſtudying to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove himſelfe as a workeman not to be aſhamed; ſtriving to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full both in the gift of diſcerning ſpirits, that he may ſpeake to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not at randon; as alſo to be painfull in catechizing, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines the wiſe and leaſurely way of God, to ſcrue and dive into the hearts of men by degrees, and to ſoke the heart in the principles of faith, which they that want may be long enough in hearing Sermons ere they conceive the order of the myſtery of faith, and how the ſoul comes to claſpe with the promiſe. Sixtly, the Lord hereby corrects thoſe moſt wicked evills which have carried the ſoule in and under the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Goſpel, eſpecially the dallying with the ſeaſons of grace. 7. That by this mean the Lord might clenſe the heart from Selfe in every kinde, and twitch up every roote and rinde of ſelfe-love which would dangerouſly mix it ſelfe with the promiſe. Laſtly, that the Lord (as I toucht before) might prepare way for himſelfe in the honour of the ſoul when it ſhall finde by experience, that all her ſalvation is of him, and he could bring it out of nothing, nay worſe then nothing, when as the ſoule lay ſtrugling with herſelfe without hope or remedy. So much for anſwer to the ſecond queſtion.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt queſtion is, how the ſoule may finde by markes, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>3</label> that the Lord is following on with the work of grace: That ſo it may be comforted in this, that ſhe is no hypocrite, and ſo ſhall not wanze and

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Marke. </seg>1</label> The firſt ſhall be this: A ſoule truly under the condition of grace is very vigilant, ſtirring and obſervant of the ſeaſons which affoord grace; not only generally to hearken after the word, but ſpecially to obſerve the Angels moving of the water. The Lord doth not alway ſtir alike: The Miniſter is not moved, nor the heart of the hearer affected alike: Its rare when the Lord and the ſoule cloſe throughly one with the other, when the word is preacht ſo ſavourly and lively, and carryes the vertue of the ſpeaker with it into the hearer, and when the hearer meets it with a diſcerning of a ſeaſon from God. But when the ſoule meets with ſuch, Oh it abhors to dally and trifle with God, to greeve him with ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, either for the preſent or after: But confeſſes it to be a rare occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, preſſes hard with the Lord for bleſſing, and followes on as <hi>Gede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> did thoſe enemies,<note place="margin">Judg. 7.</note> while the ſent was hot, leſt he ſhould be defeated. Thus doth a good heart watch her time, alway being upon wing for her prey, and loaths careleſſeneſſe of the watchwords of God. No ſin ſtings her more then former dallyings with the Lord, nothing brings her upon her knees in ſecret more then this ſinne, and the ſad fruit of it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing puts her in more feare leſt God ſhould forſake her, and ſuffer his Spirit to give over all ſaving ſtrife with her; nothing more is deſired then that the Lord would forget her many provokings this way, and ſtir her up with threefold alacrity to redeeme ſuch ſeaſons for time to come. Whereas an hypocrite ſees not ſuch mercy from God, or elſe vaniſhes in the fruit of them, lets all goe, and nouzles himſelfe in a blinde hope all ſhall be well, whiles yet old ſinnes and dallyings are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſcore, unrepented of, and unforgiven, and the ſoule hardning more and more, and waxing daily more and more crazy, and unfit to be wrought upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Marke. </seg>2</label> Secondly, a thriving ſoule God and promiſe-ward, above all things nouriſhes life in herſelfe, not onely in ordinances, but in the courſe and way of converſation. Where ever ſhe become, the Spirit of life leaves her not wholy, but (more or leſſe) accompanies her ſpirit to preſerve it from deadneſſe, flatneſſe, remiſſenes, and ſuffering the worke of God to lye by in her. And howſoever ſhe feels a very body of death in this kinde, fighting againſt the law of life in her; yet knowing which is the ſtronger, ſhe gives not place: No, although the more ſhe ſtrives to be lively and ſavoury upon the promiſe and by faith, the more the death of corruption reſiſts her and diſcourages her: yet even in this darke belly of the whale ſhe caſts her eie towards the Temple,<note place="margin">Jonah 2.8.</note> and dares not yeeld when yet ſhe is almoſt foiled; but diſcernes a baſe body of death from the deſire of her owne heart; and becauſe ſhe feeles a dying, ſhe judges herſelfe not wholly dead, but to have ſome life under the embers, which ſhe makes much of, and nouriſhes as one would hatch up one coale of fire upon dry ſtraw leſt it ſhould goe quite out. Such a ſoule abhors a daily deadiſh and ſad heart, more then death it ſelfe; labours to revive it ſelfe by all hot waters from ſwowning and dying; rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces when ſhe recovers, exerciſes her ſelfe with others (as well as in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret)
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:45715:244"/> to whet up that dull and weake edge of life and faith which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, and is glad to feele that it is not alway alike with her in this kinde. Whereas an hypocrite who never attaind to this ſweet life, is faine to ſhuffle as he is able, to counterfeit life and zeale, and when his endeavours ſucceed not, he commits all to hazard, and ſhifts off a dead heart as he can with head and ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, theſe perſons may be knowne by this, That they diſcerne <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Marke. </seg>3</label> of the diſtempers which formerly moleſted them,<note place="margin">Oppoſite to the ten for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and held them off from the promiſe, as may appeare by theſe particulars, oppoſite to the former objections named in the firſt queſtion. Firſt, they diſcover a mercy in their deep caſtings downe and feares, and in the ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage which they feele, they looke upon it not as a marke of wrath, but as the entrance upon the way of God, for their further humbling and making their heart tender, acknowledging it could not be ſpared, and looking into the promiſe for ſome hope of redreſſe. Secondly, they wiſely conſider, that the condition of faith, and the gift of faith it ſelfe, differ much; and therefore for them to reſt in any ſuch worke of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, as will not ſtabliſh their hearts in peace through the bloud of the Covenant, were a deceit of Satan, cauſing them to lye by the way when they have a further journey to goe. Affections and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances they embrace, but reſt not therein, as wanting a bottome of the ſatisfaction of Chriſt to Gods juſtice, and therefore in that they onely dare pitch their reſt, renouncing whatſoever of their owne might ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them. Thirdly, they wiſely coſinder what degrees they have atai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in grace, and dare not forget or deny what God hath already done for them, confeſſe that thouſands want that which they have; yea that its nothing but ſelfe-love which buries all former mercies under a clod of diſcontent for that which they want, and with the loweſt humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe acknowledge themſelves the leaſt of all others, and that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is not hell, is more then God owes them, they count themſelves not worth the ground they tread on, ſubmitting themſelves unto God to doe with them as he pleaſes, and willing to be as he will have them. Fourthly, they moderate their own judgements touching the matter of faith, and deſire to looke at it as that gift which God in wiſdome uſeth for the ſaving of his; neither on the one ſide making it leſſe, nor on the other ſide more high and ſolemne then God would have them, for though it be too good for them to enjoy, yet not for God to beſtow, whoſe gifts although very precious, yet are moſt free; and ſo they ſhake off that baſe ſlavery of heart which poſſeſſed them. Fifthly, they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves not as they ſhall be when faith hath clenſed them, but as now they lye, and are objects of mercy, ſuch as God purpoſes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the riches of grace upon in due time; in the meane ſeaſon they are the vileſt of all ſinners, as alſo <hi>Paul</hi> and others were in their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt eſtate: They conſider that ſinne cauſes mercy to abound, ſo it bee not wilfully committed:<note place="margin">See Acts 2.34.35.</note> And this is the honour of God to beteame it to enemies, hypocrites, proud, uncleane, prophane ones, yea Chriſt died for ſinnes againſt the Goſpel, an hard, dead, rebellious heart of unbeleefe, as well as againſt the Law: Therefore they ſee in that dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill of droſſe (alway ſteaming out of them) an occaſion of mercy in
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:45715:245"/> God, not of deſpaire, ſave in themſelves. And if they were as they would be, void of ſuch corruption, they ſhould need no mercy, they might plead merit.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.19.</note> Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, and hath ſhut up all under diſobedience, that he might ſave ſome, even the weakeſt, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt of all others; for theſe will cun him moſt thank: Phariſees need him not. As for the dogging of their corruptions, they conſider Satan moſt clogs and dogs that ſoule which is moſt earneſt to be rid of them, whereas others are ſhut up in falſe peace, and feare nothing.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, they grow to this reſolution, not to caſt feares aforehand more then they ought,<note place="margin">Micah ult. ult.</note> if God will pardon them, they doubt not but he will afterward purge them, ſubdue their corruptions for them, and finiſh his worke with perſeverance. They were not fit judges to ſpeake of time to come: What hath he who wants faith, to doe with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of him that hath it? They will therefore attend one thing at once, and not many: If once they can obtaine faith in that, they ſhall have the reſt: For why? Faith will purge the conſcience and ſet the beleever on worke to preſerve in himſelfe that which is already plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Therefore they ſee it were a great folly to hinder themſelves of a preſent mercy through the diſtruſt of a future. Seventhly, they repent them of thoſe ungrounded cavills from the length of time, the example of others, and the feare of election; and with a mourning heart for that hardneſſe and unprofitableneſſe of theirs, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be none of theirs, but Gods priviledge to appoint the times and ſeaſons of grace: They ought not to foreſtall God in this kinde, but wait his leaſure: They muſt not grudge at others but follow their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: Others are not gone ſo faſt before, but mercy can ſend them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with as good ſpeed: And as for election, it is not for them, its Gods ſecret, they know no ſuch matter that they are reprobated, but when they ſhall beleeve, they ſhall know that they are elect: Let therefore God alone with his ſecrets, confeſſe his Soveraignty and tremble, but apply themſelves to the revealed way of God, and behold his ladder and cords of mercy put downe unto them into the dungeon, and clapſe about them as they are commanded to do. Eightly, they look up to the promiſe, and thereby ſhake off their melancholy &amp; ſullennes of heart, ſee the emptineſſe, the abſurdity of their froward hearts, which God doth as much deteſt, as they admire: They ſee a world of pride, ſelf and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it, and therefore deſire to ſend it to hell whence it came, and to turn their cenſure of others into imitation of their grace. Ninthly, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, whatſoever hath witheld them from the promiſe &amp; from beholding the excellency of it, in the meaning of God, in the bounty, truth and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, conſtancy, ſtablenes, fulneſſe &amp; ſufficiency of the ſame, they ſhake it off:<note place="margin">Jonah 2.8.</note> they forſake other vanities &amp; conceits of their own, their morall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, their buſying themſelves about many things, whereby Satan (as by his golden apple) would keep them from the ſilver Bell; and therefore now, they reſolve to lay all other ſacrifices by the Altar till their recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation be made; to which end, they trade with the promiſe by meditation, and uſe all meanes to dive into it, and to looke into it, as the Angels into the Mercyſeat, till their miſery for want of it, cauſe them to venture themſelves, and jeopard their ſalvation upon it.</p>
               <pb n="451" facs="tcp:45715:245"/>
               <p>Laſtly, they correct their looſe and generall hearings of the word, purpoſing to bend their minds, (as to all the truth of God without neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, ſo) eſpecially to thoſe maine truths which they moſt ſticke at, and come ſhorteſt of, that their inſight into Gods method and way may be more evident unto them: As for novelties and fancies of men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable minds, ready to carry them away from the ſimplicity of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; whether erroneous opinions, or things which have ſome truth, but yet for the preſent are not pertinent or profitable, but might (under ſome pretence of zeale and devotion) withdraw them from their grounds ere they be ſetled, (which I obſerve to be a notable trick of the Divell to diſorder the courſe of a ſoule travelling towards heaven) they are ſhy thereof, and cannot cloſe with it. Let every one that deſires to know himſelf to thrive to Godward well, marke this whole Section. So much for this third marke.</p>
               <p>Another is, That ſuch a ſoule ſtrives after that which makes moſt <label type="milestone">

An unuſuall and unlikely thing, that ſuch a favourite to his Prince as hee was, and ſo great a Warriour, ſhould now bee ſubdued by a few followers, who had ſo ſtouted it out with the Prophet himſelfe. But as the Lord uſed this courſe to abaſe his pride: ſo hee effected that which hee ſought, and now makes him a tame Captive to meane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours. The poynt then is, An humble heart will not ſcorne the counſell and help of the meaneſt. The proud give great words, and ſcorne meane ones, thinking it a diſgrace to be dealt with by ſuch. But it muſt be a poore thing indeed which an humble ſoule will deſpiſe in the way of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.13.</note> and his ſouls welfare. This is that which <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 12. urgeth at the hands of Chriſtians, That they condiſcend to them low degree, and thinke themſelves equall unto them.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> Firſt, it muſt be ſo, becauſe humblenes is a reall grace, and diſcerns between ſhadowes and ſubſtance, and eſteemes it ſelfe not by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the former. A fooles eyes are bleared with any thing, that hee is better bred, hath more money in his purſe, hath a braver ſtomacke then his fellow: nay, if he have a little more gold in his Hat-band, or a longer lock of haire at his eares, then another. But he that hath grace is purged from ſuch ſcurfe of vanity, hee knowes that God eſteemes
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:45715:250"/> no ſuch ſtuffe, but judges by the inner man, and the vertues of the ſoule, which if an inferiour doe excell him in, he neither deſpiſes him for his meanneſſe, nor exalts himſelfe for his complements.

               <p>Secondly, by this equalling himſelfe to a lower degree, an humble <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> man ſhewes the ſoundneſſe of his humility. Many will ſeem humble enough among their Peeres and equals, though their hearts be proud, becauſe all colours of pride are removed. But hee who is humble to the meane, hath caſt off all covers of ſhame, and pretexts of pride, and ſhewes himſelf to be truly humble indeed, becauſe he might be proud under a defence. Each grace of God covets to expreſſe it ſelfe in her naked hue, without hypocriſie: and ſo humility abhorres all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety to her ſelfe, not onely open ſcorne and bluſtering, but even that ſecret queaſineſſe and coyneſſe of heart, which is (as I may ſay) the relique and ſtaine of corruption in this kinde.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by this meanes it concurres with Gods wiſedome, and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> ſtoops to his Arguments. For the Lord himſelfe to humble proud man, ſends him to the moſt baſe and contemptible creature, and doth oftentimes arme it to foyle mans pride. Now then to diſdain a meane one, being in the image of God as wel as thy ſelf, how inſolent a pride were it both againſt Man and God himſelfe?

               <p>Fourthly, by this meanes we imitate the Lord himſelfe, who hath <label type="milestone">

Let the honour of the grace, and the pretiouſneſſe of a Chriſtian, cover his outwards, and diſcerne that which is within at a narrow crevis.

But to learne of a good man or woman, the trade of God, to heare any thing from them which might rectifie either their hearts or manners, they deſpiſe it exceedingly. Shall not their own practice confute them wofully? If Religion were any of their ends, would they not do as much, &amp; abaſe themſelves as low for that, as for the learning of prick-ſong, or the like? And whereas thou wilt ſay, I will not doe ſo meane a fellow ſuch honour, as to ſubdue my ſpirit, or put my neck under his girdle. I anſwer thee, Looke thou at God, not at him: but if this defeat thee of cure, thank thy ſelfe: hee is but very little hungry, or thirſty, who will not doe a ſtone or leather pot or veſſell the honour to quench his thirſt; nor eate any meate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept out of plate, with a ſilver forke.<note place="margin">Note.</note> They that will not honour others ſo much as to learne of them, muſt be content to ſhame themſelves ſo much as to periſh.

Surely, when his ſtomack was brought down, and ſunk in him, then hee went &amp; dipped himſelfe in Jorden; when that which all this while letted, was removed, then did he obey, believe, and doe as he was bidden, and that in a moment. The poynt is very ſpeciall to prepare us to the poynt following: for it acquaints us with a main barre and ſtop which lies in the Preachers way, and the Spirits way, to wit, a rebellious and ſelfe-conceited heart: and with that which makes eaſie, and ſweet, that is, an heart convinced, and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Word. No man, I ſuppoſe, will expect me to be large in much opening of this diſeaſe: for I have ſpent many Sermons in the handling of Self, Self-love, carnall Reaſon, Rebellion, and coy Pride in <hi>Naaman,</hi> when I went over the 11. verſe. Now I take all that for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and from the iſſue of the Lords working thus long upon <hi>Naaman,</hi> &amp; his humbling of him to the command,<note place="margin">Humility al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grace.</note> compared with the effect of his obeying, I would preſent unto your eye, this poynt, That alway when the Lord means to create faith in the ſoule, he doth immediatly put an end to all that ſtoutneſſe of ſpirit that hindred the ſame. The poynt is cleare: No ſooner had the Lord emptied <hi>Naaman</hi> here of his oppoſing heart, but immediatly followes his obeying the charge. So true is that golden ſpeech of <hi>Ieremy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 31.18.19.</note> I heard Ephraim bemoaning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as an Heyfer unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed

The ſumme of the words is, That all the while that <hi>Ephraim</hi> was proud and wilfull, no grace would enter into him: But as ſoone as the Lord thawed his ſpirit, and made him humble, lo, hee preſently ſubmitted, and bare Gods yoke with meekneſſe and obedience. Prophets there were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who did beat upon him, and tozed him with rebukes and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors: but alas! they were but as the blowes of the Smith upon his Anvill, which is the more hardned. But at laſt God caſt into his heart, a ſecret thought of his long rebellion, and how little good it had done him; then by and by hee liſtned, and ſmote upon his thigh and repented. Even ſo, all the day long (ſayth the Lord by <hi>Eſay,</hi> Chap. 52.) ult. have I ſtretched out mine arme to a people in vaine. None hath beleeved my report, the word of God is revealed to none. Why? Hee addes, becauſe it is a ſtiff-necked and a gain-ſaying peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: q. d. But for this, they had beleeved long agoe.

The Aſpe ſhall ſuffer the young childe to play at the hole of the Aſpe: and the Lyon ſhall feed with the Lamb, and the Beare with the Bullocke; meaning, the ſavage and wilde diſpoſitions of men, ſhould turn meek and tractable. <hi>Iob</hi> in one place brings in the Lord asking this queſtion,<note place="margin">Job. 39.5.</note> Wilt thou tye the Unicorne to the furrow? or wilt thou make the wilde Aſſe feed at thy Crib? q. d. No, their nature is unbroken; thy Oxe and thy Horſe are fitteſt for that, whom thou haſt tamed to the worke. Even ſo aſſure thy ſelfe, the Divell and Chriſt, Light and Darkneſſe, may as ſoon comply, as a ſtout rebellious heart and grace. Rebellion and Unbeliefe yoke together, ſo doe Selfe-deniall and meekneſſe of Spirit, with faith and obedience. As while the ſinewes of mans heart is of Iron, the Lords heaven is Braſſe: ſo when the ſoul begins to melt, the Lord begins to turne and convert it. It is with the ſoule in this kinde, contrary to that it was with them in Acts 27. If theſe goe out of the ſhip, it muſt needs miſcarry. But if pride and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion abide in the heart, no grace will grow, the man muſt periſh. <hi>Ottomans</hi> horſe (they ſayd) whereſoever he became, made the graſſe, that it could not grow: ſo doth a ſtout heart keep grace from the heart. There is a ſecret intelligence between hell and a proud ſpirit: And contrarily, there is an entercourſe between an humble heart and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Hoſee</hi> in one place tells us,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.21.</note> That the Lord would ſpeake to the heavens, and they ſhould heare the earth with rains: and then the earth ſhould heare man with fruits: So, firſt heaven muſt grant the heart tenderneſſe and relenting; and then that will heare the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding and promiſing.

Surely (if you doubt, as I feare few need to doe) the enemy is this wicked <hi>Haman</hi> of a rebellious heart. Perhaps ſome of you are of another minde, becauſe you can ſo colour and cruſt over this ſore with courteſie and good words: but the truth of it is, There is an heart within, big and high, and ſtout. This is the Camell which ſuffers not the ſoule to goe through the needles eye. Somewhat is the cauſe why the felon upon the hand ſwells: it is an humor which is not yet let out; if that were out, the felneſſe would ceaſe. Enquire and conſult, either a curſed heart will keep ſome baſe luſt, which God will have out, and there the Lord and it are upon debate: or there is a curſed naturall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy between the Lord and the way of ſalvation: or the ſoule is full of teches and pritches againſt reproofe: or, it hatcheth ſome falſe conceit, that it hath obeyd when it hath not, which it will not ſee: or puffes and ſnuffes againſt ſome other thing, the Miniſter, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the difficulty of Religion, the uncertainty of the promiſe: Whatſoever it be, it is a diſtaſtfulneſſe of heart, and a reſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, which if it were not, the ſoule would nakedly come in, and obediently ſubmit to the Goſpel. But this diſeaſe hath this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, that the more dangerous it is, the leſſe it will bee convinced of ſuch a thing; and this nouriſhes the heart in her wretchedneſſe: it is not time alone which will heale it; rather it cauſes it to rankle, and wax worſe and worſe. Men aſcribe it to other matters, being willing to gull themſelves, becauſe they have no will to be rid of it: They ſay, they have weake memories, little capacity, and the Miniſter is too high for them. But in very deeds, their hearts are too high for him; till the Word come neerer,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.4.</note> and worke inward, to caſt downe all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations and high things, no ſubmiſſion will follow to the obedience of Chriſt. The effect every one dare confeſſe, but the cauſe they will not ſee: it is not unprofitableneſſe, or an ill memory, that hath cauſed your hearts to be ſo ſurly and perverſe; but it is a proud and gainſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart,<note place="margin">Acts 28.27.</note> which hath ſo long made you unprofitable. Doe not lin till you are convinced hereof: for till the cauſe be ſeene, it cannot bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.

Perhaps you doe not live in wrath and rage with your wives, family, neighbours, you make a ſhift to comply with men courteouſly, ſo long as no body hurts you: but truly, if you beleeve

How dare you dally, and venture to abide thus? How ſad a reflex will this bee upon your death-beds? You will ſay, It doth oft trouble you, and you are grieved for your waſpiſhneſſe and anger. But what then? Is that an amends to God, to vomit up that at an odde time, which afterward you doe returne to and licke up ugaine, without ſenſe or feeling? Oh! it were meet for you, to be ſo heart-ſick of it, that you might for ever abhor it. Chriſtians ſhould mark the ſecret creepings of ſuch poyſon, how it dogges them, chokes humbleneſſe and cheerfulneſſe in them, and makes them walke unfruitfully and unſetledly, from time to time.

I therefore interpret it as a ſigne of favour: yea, thou mayſt be ſure of it, and therefore repent thee not of all thy paines, which thou haſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for it, ſeeing thy reward will abundantly anſwer thy travaile.

                  </label> The point is: Every one who is able to prove himſelfe,<note place="margin">Every ſoule within the condition of mercy, ought to beleeve.</note> within the condition of the promiſe, may and ought to caſt himſelfe upon it, obey the command of God, and beleeve. For the proofe of the point, it will be expedient that firſt we cleare the ground of it, out of the example of <hi>Naaman</hi> in generall; and then by ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident texts of Scriptures, with a briefe reaſon or two. And having ſo done, we will proceed to the explication of the contents of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. For the generall correſpondence of <hi>Naamans</hi> caſe with this
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:45715:255"/> point, ſome may doubt, how it may be ſaid of an Heathen, in the point of curing of a bodily diſeaſe, how he can be ſaid to bee under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a promiſe, and ſo to believe? For anſwer <label type="milestone">

                  </label> whereof, I ſay as before, that although the worke of grace were a ſtranger unto him, in reſpect of his owne feeling, untill the time that the Lord wrought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed grace in his heart: yet foraſmuch as the Lord over-ruled all the occurrents in the buſineſſe, by his owne hand, for the effecting of that which he intended, and ſwayed his heart to thoſe preparations which were fit to lead to ſuch an effect. Therefore I do not ſee why (on Gods behalfe) thoſe ſeverall diſpoſitions which were in <hi>Naaman,</hi> may not be proportionable unto thoſe which are wrought in ſuch as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to God. That <hi>Naaman</hi> was truly brought home to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſequell in the Chapter, mee thinkes this is ſufficient, that not onely God would chuſe him as the onely Leper whom <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſhould heale: but alſo would order the circumſtances thereof in ſo ſet and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne a manner, that all men may behold a gracious worke as well as a miraculous. For I demand, what ſhould need ſo many interruptions and defeats in the miracle, ſuch a trying and ſearching of a mans Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſuch a purpoſed drawing of him, to ſee more then an externall hand in the thing, except more then an outward cure had beene inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God? A very ſmall and ſhort matter might elſe have been made of it, if the Prophet had been uſed onely to heale his body: and (as <hi>Naaman</hi> thought) the bare comming out, and laying his hand on, or ſpeaking two or three words, might have ſerved the turne. But now the Prophet muſt not bee ſeen, <hi>Naamans</hi> weakneſſe muſt be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to himſelfe; and hence it appeares, that the Lord would have his Spirit and Soule acquainted with God as well as his outward man. So much for the anſwer of the doubt: And ſo I come to ſhew what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions were wrought in <hi>Naaman</hi> before his cure, and then how his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience muſt be an act of faith, iſſuing thereupon: reſpiting proofes and reaſons till the Doctrine be ſuted to the Text; till which it will not be ſeaſonable to ſettle it upon her bottome.

In the former we ſaw how the Lord by a bodily diſeaſe made him in the generall caſe of one needing eaſe: for he abaſed his perſon (in the midſt of ſundry other happineſſes) with the noyſome diſeaſe of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, which was in it ſelfe a marvellous yoke, and (as God guided it) a very pinching one unto him, burdening him more then in a common manner.<note place="margin">How Naaman was under the condition of of cure.</note> If this had not been, the firſt ground of the worke had been removed. Next hereto, the Lord prevents him very ſweetly with the newes of one who (in ſuch a deſperate caſe) is credibly reported un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, to be a man like to heale him, and this comes to him by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall providence appointing a skirmiſh between <hi>Aram</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> wherein a Damoſell might be taken priſoner, and ſuch a one (one of a thouſand) who had taken notice of <hi>Eliſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>'s</hi> worth in this kinde: and this being by <hi>Naaman</hi> apprehended, tooke off utter deſpaire of incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſſe, and put him into ſome hope of a poſſible cure. Thirdly, hereupon he ſlackens no time, but addreſſes himſelfe in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to uſe the moſt apt and likely meanes for the commending of his buſineſſe to the Prophet, and for the bringing of him to the ſpeech of the Prophet, having (no doubt) a ſpeciall deſire to obtaine that real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereof hee ſaw poſſibility before. Fourthly, by his travell and
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:45715:256"/> furniſhing himſelfe with gifts, attendance, comming to the King of Iſrael with his meſſage, (wherein he was greatly defeated) he is by the Lord ſo mercifully aſſiſted, that he ceaſed not till by the Prophets owne intimation, and further light and aſſurance not only of a poſſible, but alſo of a likely cure, hee comes to the Prophets owne houſe, and ſtands there to receive his direction: Which ſhewed how reſtleſſe this hope of his made him, and what ſingular eſtimation was bred in him of the Prophet. Fifthly, he ſtanding at the Prophets curteſie, hearing the errand, is marvellouſly offended at it, as too ſlow and leaſurely for his haſty ſpirit; and bewrayes thereupon what a deale of ſcurfe lay within, to cavill againſt it, and to breake off his former hopes and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, unto an utter diſtaſte and rebellion againſt the way of God, with a furious reſolution to give over, becauſe he neither could ſpeake with the Prophet, nor brooke his direction: which yet was all by God ſweetly governed ſo, that being upon this tickle point, yet was he not ſuffered to depart and goe out of Gods bleſſing into his owne warme Sunne, and to ſinke in his owne carnall ſelfe-love: but ſtronglier aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted then ever, and ſet upon by ſuch powerfull perſwaſions to obey the Prophets counſell, as (although very unlike to prevaile with ſuch a ſpirit) yet wrought out ſelfe-love and pride, and made his ſpirit, at the laſt to come downe and ſubmit thereto moſt readily. And theſe were the paſſages of Gods prevention and aſſiſtance. Now for the perfecting worke of God, it is moſt cleare in this verſe, wherein, his heart being humbled, he aſſents to the Prophet both commanding and promiſing: and (as a man in a fit condition for the purpoſe) doth that which before hee was very unfit for, obeyes, beleeves, goeth down and waſheth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in Jorden.</p>
               <p>Thus having made way to the poynt collected hence,<note place="margin">Proofes of the Doctrine.</note> I proceed to prove the truth thereof by Scripture; which is not more fertile in any one thing then in proving of this. For although the words of [con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the promiſe] be not in the Scripture, in tearmes; yet are they equivalently and in effect everywhere in the word both in the Old &amp; New Teſtament. As, when our Saviour ſaith,<note place="margin">Luke 5.31.32</note> I came not to call the righteous, but the ſinners to repentance: And, the whole have no need of the Phyſitian, but the ſicke: not ſtomack-ſick, who can eaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by vomiting, but the heart-ſicke; and not onely ſo neither, but thoſe that are ſo deadly ſicke, as no other Phyſitian can heale. I am no Phyſitian for fees, but in meere mercy, when no mercenary one can helpe, then for meere pitty, and to ſave life, I will help: rather then a ſoule ſhould miſcary, and rather for the honour of my skill, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,<note place="margin">Eſa. 55.1.</note> then for gaine (for I take neither money nor price for my cure) I will heale him, Eſay 57.17.<note place="margin">Eſa. 57.17.</note> Marke upon what termes and conditions Chriſt cures: even as Jorden cured <hi>Naaman,</hi> when Abana &amp; Pharphar were out of date, and himſelfe at a plunge: ſo, when a ſinner is ſuch in his owne ſenſe, (all are ſo, but yet in their element, as a fiſh in the water, feeling no weight of it) feeles it, is convinced of it, and neere to execution, for ought is in himſelfe. What elſe ſave this condition, is implyed in all thoſe Parables of the loſt ſheep, loſt groat,<note place="margin">Luke 15 4.8.11. Matth. 15.24.</note> prodigall Sonne? Thoſe that were never loſt, alway found, alway with their
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:45715:257"/> father, no fatherleſſe children are excluded out of this number. Why muſt that ſon ſpend all, try the hard world, bee forlorn and forſaken, ere he knew the true worth of a father, ere his father comes out to kiſſe him, to put on all thoſe abiliments upon him, to kil the fat Calf to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him? Why did he not ſo to his other good Son, who was alway with him, and therefore needed no Kid nor Calfe? Becauſe hee was alway well, and therefore it had been ridiculous ſo to expreſſe himſelf to him, he would have thought his father a foole in ſo doing. Thus <hi>Hoſee</hi> expreſſes the Condition,<note place="margin">Hoſee 13.3.</note> Aſhur ſhall not ſave us, wee will not ride upon horſes. Why? It was no courſe to thrive: But with thee the fatherleſſe finde mercy. Why? Becauſe it is Gods condition and qualification of ſuch as he will ſave. So Eſay 57.16.17. I am high and holy, but I looke downe, and picke out ſome above others, to make my favourites.<note place="margin">Eſay 28.9.</note> Who are they? The humble ones, to revive the contrite ones; and what will hee doe to ſuch? Hee will create the fruit of the lippes (which is faith, and thereby) peace, to the neere and to the farre off, and reſtore comfort to their mourners. So elſewhere, I will powre water upon the thirſty grounds,<note place="margin">Eſay 44.3.</note> and thirſty lands, ſuch as are ſcorcht and gape for my raines to refreſh them. Againe, whom ſhall I teach wiſedome? To whom ſhall I give inſtruction? Not to all, but to ſuch as are under the condition of it, humble, trembling ones, and weaned from the breaſts, fooles and Ideots. Small credit is to be got by ſuch as have more wiſedome then ſeven men beſides, ſuch as are full of it, but to make a foole wiſe, is ſomewhat worth. How often doth the Lord Jeſus in one Chapter urge this Condition? Bleſſed are the poore in ſpirit,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.3.4.5.</note> the hungry after righteouſneſſe, the meeke in heart. Theirs is the Kingdome, they ſhall bee ſatisfied, and the like. Why not others? Doe not they want it? Yes: but they need it not, it were ill beſtowed. The Kingdome of God is like to a Merchant,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.43.44</note> who ſought a Pearle of price; which having found, hee weighed the worth of it: he hid it; hee went and ſold all his reall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and bought it. Every one could not ſo value it, venture all upon it.<note place="margin">Jam. 4.7.8.</note> Submit your ſelves under the mighty hand of God (ſaith <hi>Iames.</hi>) And what then? When you are downe, the Lord will raiſe you up. Thoſe that be raiſed already, care not for this preferment. And to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh proofes, what meaneth the holy Ghoſt, by deſcribing all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts by this condition? what went before the converſion of thoſe murderers of the Lord of life? They were convinced of their blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy malice, and of the mercy of Chriſt, who was willing to ſave them that ſlew him;<note place="margin">Act. 2.37.</note> and then they were prickt in heart. What then? Men and brethren, what ſhall wee doe? What made their bowels earne, and made them glad to learne of the Apoſtles? The ſame grace that made them humble. What cauſed the Iaylor to come leaping in to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> whom he had whipped and wronged? His heart was broke to ſee the mercy which God ſhewed him,<note place="margin">Act. 14.</note> and in the keeping in of the Priſoners to ſave his ſoule. So much for proofes.</p>

As in humiliation there is a ſeed of repentance, and in affection of deſire and prizing of Chriſt, is included a ſeed of love, remotely, and in Selfe-deniall is implied a ſeed of mortification, darkly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapenly, as in the firſt life of an infant, is (in a ſort) included all after ripenings and perfections till the birth. Now if there ſhould bee an interruption, and a gulfe ſet, ſo that one of theſe could not come at the other, then muſt God bee made a God, not of order, but of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe perſons thus qualified, muſt and ought to believe, becauſe it <label type="milestone">

               <p>Becauſe the promiſe of believing containes in it the effect of all the <label type="milestone">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fore I will a little lend my help for explication hereof, and ſo come to the uſes. For the firſt, concerning the nature of this Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith, my purpoſe is not to bring in large diſcourſe into a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, nor to ſatisfie cavillers about it: I have already done that (ſo farre as I thinke their mouthes worth the ſtopping) in another place.<note place="margin">In my Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme, Part. 2. Artic. 7.</note> That which here I will adde, ſhall be but this; That whereas many carp at the condition of faith, who yet underſtand it not, let them know, there is a twofold condition; the one procuring, the other ſignifying.<note place="margin">Condition of faith is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing, but on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly a ſignifying thing.</note> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing, deſerving, and working conditions, we abhorre; but ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conditions we allow: not as our owne workes, but as Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious diſpoſitions in us, ſignifying what hee hath wrought in us, and thereby evidencing what hee further intends to worke. And hereof there is great uſe: both becauſe, as ſinne was not brought to ripeneſſe all at once in us, ſo neither is grace: Alſo, becauſe the worke of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but leaſurely and graduall, hardly perceived, we ſhould not be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie to it, if God did not point at it by ſenſible and diſcernable affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as of hope, deſire, ſorrow: but the worke would ſeeme to lye dead in us. Laſtly alſo, becauſe the caſe ſo ſtands with ſome converts, who are called out of a profane eſtate; that if their turning ſhould bee all at once, and on the ſudden, they would feare leſt it would prove but ſome violent pang and extremity in them, not like to hold long. But when they can perceive a ſenſible change by certaine ſteps ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively,<note place="margin">Why this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is requ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> they diſcerne a more divine hand therein, and are much ſtayed and ſatisfied. Adde to theſe, That the Lord in this caſe doth not ſo much look at his own power, what he could doe at once; as at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſuch as he worketh upon, whoſe narrow neckes cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive much at once, but by drop-meale: and all, through that unſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualneſſe of our heart, not eaſily capable of holy things. A crooked cry ſome doth not looke upward with more difficulty, then our frame receives grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The worker of it.</note>Secondly, take knowledge of this, that the immediate worker of theſe preparations, is two-fold: The former is the convincing power of the Law: the latter is the ſucceeding conviction of the Goſpel. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this latter, know that although the ſame thing workes faith it ſelfe, which workes this condition, yet by a divers meaſure of aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, according to the capacity of the Soule: which at the firſt is drawne to ſee ſo much light in the promiſe, as winnes affections to the ſame, for that excellent pretiouſneſſe, gaine and happineſſe which it heares to be offered therein. But in time it ſees not onely ſo much, but more cloſely alſo applies it ſelfe thereto by faith and affiance of ſoule, as a thing in ſpeciall offered and belonging unto herſelfe; yet both are
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:45715:258"/> wrought by the Goſpel, and neither comes from our ſelves: both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from free grace, ſo that wee muſt not conceive, that the Lord doth offer Chriſt to ſuch as can work their owne hearts to ſorrow, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or eſteem of grace, (for what is ſo contrary to us as theſe things?) But the Lord in working them upon us by the Spirit of Grace, in a weaker degree at the firſt, and unſhapen, doth at laſt by the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit bring them to a more full and formed degree, in ſuch as are to bee ſaved. Thirdly note,<note place="margin">It is a middle thing between meere corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and grace.</note> that this preparation ſtands in a middle nature between meer corruption &amp; the gift of grace it ſelfe, peculiarly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: Preparation is neither to bee called meere Nature, nor any thing which nature alone can affoord: nor yet can it bee called Faith; but a previous ſupernaturall worke, which in them that periſh by ſuffering it to decay, comes to nothing: but in the elect, ends in effectuall calling and beleeving the promiſe. Fourthly note, that yet this muſt not bee truſted unto, as if it were in it ſelfe ſufficient to make the ſoule happy: for ſtill, that which the poore ſinner muſt cling and cleave to, for her pardon &amp; peace, muſt be that only bloud of Chriſt, the ſati factio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of juſtice. She muſt lay hold on this, and make it her owne, by faith in the promiſe. Thus much for the preſent comes in my minde, to tell you, touching the nature of this Condition. Now I come to the ſteps of it.</p>
               <p>The firſt property iſſueth from the convincing power of the morall Law,<note place="margin">It is not to be truſted to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. The ſteppes of it: 1.

One thing I will adde, (which there I omitted) <hi>viz.</hi> to lay you downe ſome markes, whereby you may diſcerne this condition of the Law. All that are loaden, loſt, deadly heart-ſick of the Law, are bidden to come to Chriſt: But who are theſe? 1. Such as cannot look back into their former eſtate of jollity, liberty, and life in ſinne uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, without wondring and deteſtation of themſelves. 2. A loaden ſoule feeles her ſelfe diſcharged quite from thoſe falſe ſhoulders that ſuffered not ſo intollerable a load of ſinne, and curſe to be felt, but kept the ſoule in a rotten peace. The Law abandons eaſe, ſecurity, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, peace, pleaſures, mirth and company, ignorance and ſelfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, which would not endure ſinne to ſettle upon her right ſubject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lets in a veine of vengeance in ſtead of the veine of vanity and careleſneſſe. 3. The ſoule in this caſe fares as a thing oppreſſed with that which exceeds it. As in all naturall exceſſes, there is either a weakning or deſtroying of the Patient. If light or heat be too exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively offered to the eye, or fire to the touch, they deſtroy both: So this wrath of God ceazing exceſſively upon conſcience, doth ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally kill it. 4. This loading is ſuch as exceeds all concealment, or bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in by modeſty, or patience; it muſt vent it ſelfe, Act. 2. Men and bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hren what ſhall we doe? 5. It is glad to heare of the leaſt eaſe: not cavilling with the Inſtrument, but joying in it. 6. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes God might juſtly cruſh her in peeces, without any purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe her. 7. She walkes for ever after, much more warily and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:45715:259"/> againſt ſin, then ſuch as never felt this load, though their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be greater. 8. This load is unto the ſoule, as a venomed Dart ſticking to the fleſh, or a burden nailed to the ſhoulder; not poſſible to be puld off, but the more ſhe ſtruggles, the more it ſettles. 9. Other mens loads trouble her not ſo much as her owne: ſhee hath no leaſure to jangle of them, having ſo much to doe at home. 10. Though God ſhould eaſe her, ſhee would not readily return to her old vomit. 11. It is not ſuch a load that cruſheth a legge or an arme; but ſuch as oppreſſes the whole man in each faculty and member. 12. It is not ſuch a load neither as quite deſtroyes; but the ſoule is ſuſtained by God from utter ſinking, till ſhee heare further. Thus much of the Legall.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond work is from the Goſpel.</note>Before any further preparation is wrought, the Lord miniſters to the ſoule a further light, and that is the Goſpel, which brings newes to the ſoule in ſuch an eſtate, of a poſſible remedy, through the grace of Chriſt. I muſt not inſiſt in things largely handled elſewhere; but take them for granted here: The ſumme is, that the Lord in the view of that full ſatisfaction of the Lord Jeſus, offers full and free delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and eaſe to a ſoule thus loaden, without any equivocation or fraud: And withall diſcovers to her the moſt pretious view of all the good things of God purchaſed for her; though pardon immediately, yet conſequently all other, whereby ſhe may bee made perfectly hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>py, and rid of her thraldome. And according to the ſoules meaſures in the revealing of this light unto her, ſhe comes more or leſſe forward in thoſe affections and diſpoſitions, which wee call Evangelicall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration: of which, there had rather bee a volume made then a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and (as elſewhere I have promiſed) I intend a ſpeciall Treatiſe of them, if God grant life and liberty: (at leaſt of ſo many of them as I have not already handled in other Treatiſes.<note place="margin">Evangelicall preparings ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Negative or Poſitive.</note>) Now it ſhall bee ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to point at them (this being the leaſt part of the Doctrine under our hand) and then I will come to the latter branch. This Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call preparation is of two ſorts: The one negative, and of them I point at theſe foure: Firſt, a ſtopping of the Soul from her old courſes, and from relapſing into them. Secondly, a great ſorrow of heart for ſin paſt. Thirdly, a ſpeciall averſation and abhorring for time to come. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Selfe-deniall. The other ſort of theſe I call poſitive; and heer take theſe foure alſo: Firſt, an hope raiſed up in the ſoule, which cauſeth her to hold ſtill on with God in his way. Secondly, deſire encreaſing more and more after mercie. Thirdly, an high prizing of it, above all earthly treaſure. Fourthly, reſtleſſe diligence, in uſe of all meanes, till her deſire be accompliſhed with fainting under delay. All theſe are the fruit of the Goſpell, drawing the ſoule to bee willing to hearken after God, although as yet ſhe cannot incorporate herſelfe into the promiſe, nor put Chriſt on as a garment made fit for her; yet by theſe ſhe is drawne to looke toward him: And therefore to ſpeake a word of each, not as I named them, but in their order: Firſt, I ſay, Such a ſoule is loth to give over that little taſte ſhe hath of him, nor can bee pulled from her hearings, duties, prayers and meanes, nor perſwaded to revolt to her old vanities.<note place="margin">Pſal. 85.4.</note> As <hi>David</hi> ſaith, Such as hearken
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:45715:259"/> after God s mercy, returne no more to folly. Secondly, ſuch an one, by the Goſpel conceives an hope a farre off, as it were a glimpſe of light through a cloud, that her eſtate is not quite forlorne: whereupon the extremity of her former feares is much alayd, and ſhee put out of deſpaire, into ſome expectation of better things, although (as in the twilight) much mixture of old terrors remain not quite baniſhed, as the Canaanites among Iſrael, to teach them warre, and to occupy them in combats. Thus was it with thoſe Ninevites, who by the inſtinct of mercy darted into them by the Lord ſecretly, lifted up their heads a little towards hope of not periſhing, and to the muſing upon the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of deliverance. The third is an holy compaſſion of heart towards him whom the ſoul hath pierced by ſinne, even the Lord of life, who yet was well content to be murthered, leſt his murtherers ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. The due meditation whereof melts the ſoul into marvellous hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe, that ſhe ſhould ſeeke his ruine, who ſought her making. Not as mourning for his death (for elſe ſhe muſt have for ever been damned) but for her treachery againſt the mercy of a Father, who cut off his Plea; and the love of a Saviour who gave his life for her. This makes her impotent in her mourning, and ſteeps her in gall and wormwood,<note place="margin">Zachar. 12.10.</note> as not able to utter indignation enough againſt her ſelfe for it. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet as one borne downe with the ſingularity of ſuch mercy, and the fulneſſe of that price which is paid to juſtice for her ſinne, ſhee is loth to let it paſſe without a deſire to partake it; yea, and an ardent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection after it, as one that is famiſhed for lack of bread or drinke, can be ſatisfied with nothing ſave that which it longs for, though ſhee were offered treaſures in ſtead of it: yet ſhee ſtill cries with <hi>Rachel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 30.1.</note> Give me this, or elſe I dye. And fifthly, here ſhe ſtoppes not, but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily lookes about her, that ſhe binde not the hands of mercy from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing her deſire upon her, by her boldneſſe and looſneſſe of heart &amp; life, and therfore ſhe is watchful to her ſelf, leſt in this her purſuit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mercy, ſhe ſhould offend it any way, by her pride, frowardneſſe, baſe words, paſſions, or behaviours, worldlineſſe, commonneſſe of heart about her earthly lawfull buſineſſe, looſe hearing, forgetfulneſſe, or the like. Sixthly, ſhe is marvellous reſtleſſe in the applying of her ſelfe to all ſuch meanes and ordinances as might further her deſires, and reveale unto her more light and evidence of Chriſt; fearing leſt by any defect of hers, and letting ſlip the opportunities and ſeaſons of grace, and ſtirring motions of the Spirit, ſhee might provoke the Spirit of grace to give her over to her owne unprofitableneſſe: ſhe tries all, as aſcribing that honour to God, to chuſe what he will worke by: to theſe hornes of the Altar ſhe will cleave, and if ſhee muſt dye, ſhee will dye there. Seventhly, the more ſhe growes in underſtanding of the way, and myſtery of ſalvation by Chriſt, the more ſhee compares it with the beſt contents which this world in any kinde did ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto her; and finding them light in the ballance, and farre from being what they ſeeme, or performing what they promiſe: nay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they could doe both, yet in compariſon with mercy, ſhee ſtamps them under her feet, eſteeming them all as droſſe and dung.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> Laſtly, by this meanes ſhe reſolves fully in her laſt thoughts, to ſell off
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:45715:260"/> all whatſoever might ſeeme pretious unto her, luſts, liberties, vertues, Religious duties, yea, that onely ſtop of grace, the mixture of Selfe with Chriſt, that ſo ſhee might in the loſſe of all, make up a price of grace, that is, that ſhe may come with nothing, and make a price of no price, and ſo buy the Pearl; till which purchaſe be made her own, ſhe can have no peace: And this purchaſe ſtands in her faith, which as an hand takes and accepts the ſeaſin and delivery of the Lord Jeſus, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to her by the hand of him that ſurrenders him unto her, by the promiſe. Touching the which act of faith, it remaines that we ſpeake a little, having ſaid of this preparation ſo much as for the preſent wee think meet.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Touching faith what it is, and how it is bred in the ſoule.</note>Concerning which, and firſt of the nature of it (ſo farre as it is the act of the ſoule obeying and yeelding to a word of promiſe) I will ſay a little, as may beſt ſute the Text here under our hand. <hi>Naaman</hi> then (we ſee) overſwayed by his ſervants, doth ſubmit himſelfe to the word of the Prophet, and hee goes to Jorden, and waſheth.

                  </gap>e fully confute them, our firſt defenders would maintaine, that the nature of juſtifying and ſaving faith ſtood in aſſurance, which Tenet was indeed more then a confutation: for although it is the portion of none ſave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers to enjoy this aſſurance, yet neither is it the portion of all that beleeve, to attaine it (but only ſome ſpecial ones to whom it is granted) neither is that aſſurance which ſuch have, the formal act of their faith, but rather an effect or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequent of the act of beleeving, &amp; of an higher meaſure then that is. For ſure it is, the greater our feeling of aſſurance is, the leſſe our faith is. To ſhew then what it is: It is ſuch an act of the ſoule, as upon good ground and warrant, caſts her ſelfe upon the promiſe for pardon and life. By [caſting her ſelfe] can be meant no aſſurance within her ſelfe, but a ſubmiſſion and reſigning up of her ſelfe to the promiſe, in reſpect of that power and truth of the Promiſer who bids her come, and hee will eaſe her. This is a ſure word, and hath neither trick nor device in it, neither hooke nor crooke, but is that which it imports, and cannot deceive: And this ſure word is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which faith lookes at: Shee lookes not ſo much at the aſſurance which ſhee feeles within her ſelfe; but at the certaine and infallible truth of the Word without. As for her ſelfe, ſhee knowes ſhee is full of doubts, feares and unſetledneſſe; but ſo is not the Word of God, nor himſelfe that ſpeakes in it. She even in the very act of believing, is full of ſtrife and ſtruggling. For the making of this plaine, conſider faith in all her paſſages, and you ſhall ſee it.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>1</label> The ſoule hath three queſtions. The firſt queſtion is, whither the Soule ſhall turne her ſelfe in her legall ſtraits? Fleſh ſaith thus; Goe on no further towards the promiſe: for it is a difficult worke to believe, and unlikely to take effect; or if it doe, yet thou ſhalt alway be doubtfull. The Word on the contrary ſaith; Doe not deſiſt, nor
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:45715:260"/> revolt to thy former pleaſure in ſin, for in that courſe there is no hope, thou art then in a deſperate caſe: Proceed rather and goe to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, for thereby its poſſible thou maiſt find ſome redreſſe. What doth the ſoul in this ſtrife? She compares the argument of the word, with the counſell of the fleſh, and findes it better then this; becauſe it is farre more ſafe to chuſe a poſſible redreſſe of miſery, then to fall upon the aſſured pykes of certaine wo and deſpaire. Here we ſee a fight, but no victory, no aſſurance; only that reſt which the ſoule hath, is not from any thing ſhe feeles within herſelfe, but without in the word.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here comes in a ſecond doubt, and therein Satan tells <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>2</label> the ſoule, it is true, Thou chuſeſt hope before deſpaire, but what haſt thou to doe with peace? Or how knoweſt thou whether thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt rather to chuſe the one, then the other, or what right haſt thou to eaſe and pardon? Here againe ſteppes in the word, and ſuccours the ſoule, telling her, That ſhe ought to faſten upon life and pardon, and chuſe it before ſinne and death; for God hath bred in her the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of faith, a longing, mourning, reſtleſſe, ſelfe-denying heart, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to her and to no other this pardon and eaſe belongs, and ſhe may claime it. God indeed hath no where ſaid in his word, I will pardon thee <hi>Iohn,</hi> thee <hi>Thomas,</hi> &amp;c. But he hath ſaid, ſuch and ſuch I will pardon, ſo and ſo qualified: Now ſhe aſſumes this qualification to herſelfe, and therefore ſhe concludes, that to her it belongs. This is another word of the Spirit, which ſtill drawes on a poore ſoule to bee willing to beleeve.</p>
               <p>But now comes the neareſt worke of the Spirit in the word, and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>3</label> that anſwers a third objection, which is this:<note place="margin">How ſhall I know in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all its mine owne?</note> Perhaps it may belong unto ſuch a one as I am, but many things belong to men, which yet they are by one meanes or other defeated of: How ſhall I know that God will give it me in ſpeciall, and grant me the gift of faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it? In this, the word grapples cloſely and nearly with the ſoule, and brings it to the ſtrict point of beleeving, and tells the ſoule, That all to whom the promiſe of pardon and life belongs by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of God, he will moſt undoubtedly bring it to paſſe for them, and conferre it upon them; yea and give them faith to caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon it. For in ſaying, Come unto me all you loaden ones, and I will eaſe you, he meanes not onely you may, but you muſt come; not only it belongs unto you to come, but I will, in my calling you, enable you to come, and put ſtrength and power into you to come, that is to beleeve, and by beleeving, eaſe you. By this, the word ſetles the ſoule upon the promiſe, as being that which it ſeemes; ſhe ſees God is willing ſhe ſhould beleeve, and therefore will conferre it on her: And in ſo doing, the Spirit cauſeth the heart which is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to become effectually willing, that is, takes away all feare of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating, and tells her, ſhe ſhall ſpeed of her deſire; and therefore now ſhe dares venture, and caſt herſelfe upon the promiſe, and if ſhe periſh ſo, ſhe is content, for ſhe dares jeopard her ſoule upon Gods Truth. Now we ſee this caſting and venturing upon the promiſe is the beſt of all theſe three acts of the word; and yet here is no aſſurance, for the ſoule, in reſpect of herſelfe, is nevertheleſſe full of doubting; all her
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:45715:261"/> bottome is this laſt word of the promiſer, that he will effect that in the ſoule which he hath promiſed: By all theſe I inferre, The act of faith is no aſſurance within, but an evidence without, reſting upon the word; which word the more evident it is made to the ſoule, the better and ſtronger is the act of beleeving, but the beſt of theſe is no aſſurance. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> It will bee demanded, May not aſſurance be had at all? I anſwer, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> yes, it may be, and is the portion of ſuch as the Lord ſees meet to enjoy it;<note place="margin">Eph. 1. Rom. 8.</note> but that ſtands upon another bottome, and that is the immediate evidence of the Spirit in the conſcience of one who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready a beleever, making her to know that ſhe beleeves. This is not by the word directly, but the Spirit of the word which reflects that into the heart with knowledge and feeling, which before ſhe only had by the fidelity of the Promiſer. But, this (as I ſaid) is not faith, (for then none ſhould have faith who want this, which God forbid;) but an effect of faith in ſome ſpeciall perſons, and not all that beleeve. Thus much for the former queſtion. Now for the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> how faith is wrought.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of a pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſe, is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of faith.</note>You ſee brethren it is evident, that the nature and worke of ſaving faith ſtands not in any fulneſſe of ſailes, or reflex knowledge and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpowring ſweetneſſe of perſwaſion: But (as I ſaid) in a grounded caſting herſelf upon the word: For by this only mean faith is wrought. And I call it (grounded) becauſe ſo weighty a matter as the reſting and caſting of the ſoule upon a thing, requires, that the thing bee a foundation of great warrant to beare up a ſoule from revolting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Nay, when the conſcience is come thus farre, as to faſten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word, Oh! ſhe hath thouſand objections againſt the ſincere meaning of God in his word. Hence it is, that the word is ſo full of places wherein this ſufficiency of the promiſe to reſt upon is urged: Sometime the Lord conteſts with them that quarrell againſt it. Is the Arme of the Lord ſhortned? Hath he ſaid it, and it ſhall not come to paſſe? <hi>Hezechia</hi> tells us, Eſay 38.15. He hath ſpoken himſelfe unto us, and he hath done it, Heb. 13.5. For he hath ſaid, I will not faile, nor forſake thee. So againe, The mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it. Among men its called an unſure argument to prove a thing by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, becauſe men are liars further then their truth will ſpeake for them: And yet ſome great perſons have born ſuch ſway and authority in the hearts of their Diſciples, that their bare word hath carried aſſent with it. But to be ſure, this is a ſure argument God hath ſaid it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is true, as in all the words which ever went out of his mouth, ſo eſpecially in his promiſe,<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 2 Cor. 1.20.</note> that above all, pleads certainty. Faithfull is he who hath promiſed, who alſo will effect it. And <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Luke 1. tells <hi>Mary,</hi> There ſhall bee a performance from the Lord to his handmaid of that which he hath promiſed. All the promiſes of God are Yea and Amen in Chriſt Jeſus, with a thouſand more. But gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall texts ſatisfie not a ſcrupulous ſoule in ſo weighty a matter; and fleſh is ready to ſay, what ſigne from heaven ſheweſt thou us of theſe things? We would ſee ſome ſight, or heare ſome voice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the word. Ah poore ſoule! I may ſay of thee as the Scripture ſpeakes of <hi>Samuel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.</note> thus did he ere he knew the Lord; ſo theſe are thy
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:45715:261"/> crotchets ere thou kneweſt the promiſe: But afterward thou ſaweſt more in that alone, then in all other waies; for the Promiſe and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.</note> is written with the finger of God by the penne of the Spirit dipt in the bloud of God. But (to utter what God is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have ſpoken) I muſt ſay that he who might claime this abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power over the ſoule to be beleeved upon his bare word: yet, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſuality of man, and our wofull diſtruſt, is willing to allow us all the meanes of ſtrengthening our ſoules in his promiſe, both by ſuch ſeales and witneſſes as confirme it, yea Miracles, Sacraments, and oaths, annexed to his Covenant, and eſpecially by thoſe properties of a promiſe, and of him that makes it; and all to conclude and ſet the controverſie beyond queſtions. And by this meane faith is wrought.</p>
               <p>In the which courſe of God, appeares his great love and wiſdome; for herein hee hath endeavoured to anſwer all our doubts and carnall objections; we are not ſo ready to caſt in feares, as he by this meane caſts them out. For why, O poore ſoule doſt thou ſuſpect the Lord will not ſatisfie thy deſire in giving thee Chriſt? Either it muſt bee becauſe there is no ground or cauſe for which he ſhould doe it,<note place="margin">The ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</note> and this is anſwered by his freedome &amp; graciouſneſſe: Or he is a God juſt and revenging ſin, but this is taken away by ſatisfaction made &amp; taken: Or becauſe he cannot, and this is falſe, for his power is omnipotent: Or becauſe he meant it not eternally: But the promiſe is from election: Or wills not in time: But that he doth, for he invites and beſeeches us, Or he is not wiſe enough to compaſſe it: But that he is, for he is wiſdome: Or he is untrue in his performance: But that he is not, for he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: Or he may change, but that he cannot, for he is immutable: So that let us but ſet perfection of nature and grace in him, againſt that which is in us, our diſtruſt and unbeleefe, and we ſhall ſee every ſore hath his plaſter, each diſtemper hath his medicine. And all theſe are included in a promiſe: So that whoſoever hath the gift of ripping up a promiſe aright ſhould behold all Gods riches in it: But is a great skill, and the promiſes of God lye in the Scriptures, as gold and je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells lye deep in the earth, at leaſt in the field of the Goſpell, and we are not aware of them, nor acquainted with that fulneſſe and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is in them: And many confeſſe one of theſe, who will not acknowledge another; grace comes in drop by drop, elſe, wee ſhould looke upon a promiſe with other eyes, then (for the moſt part) the moſt of us doe. A word or two of each of the branches.</p>
               <p>For the firſt: Freedome: true it is,<note place="margin">1. Freedome.</note> there is nothing in thee to procure ſuch mercy; but he is of his owne accord, for his owne ſake,<note place="margin">Eſay 63.4.</note> cut off his plea, &amp; thought thoughts of peace, he hath done it for the glory of his grace, even becauſe he will ſhew mercy; it better pleaſed him ſo to doe, then the firſt creating of <hi>Adam;</hi> for now by his fall, he addes mercy to goodneſſe, and magnifies himſelfe in many attributes more, Juſtice, Wiſdome and Truth: He ſeekes nothing elſe, ſave the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and binding of the ſoule to him for ever in covenant which elſe ſo treacherous an heart as ours would never have yeelded to: So that thou maiſt well truſt him in this reſpect, if thy faith can but get in with
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:45715:262"/> the Lord; for if he do it not for thine ends, yet for his own he will, ſo that thou canſt ſet thine owne under his; ſo that thy beſt prop will be, the preciouſneſſe of his glory, which he will not give to another, and therefore thy unbeleefe ſhall not rob him of it.<note place="margin">2. Strength.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, ſatisfaction is made and taken; therefore he hath ground enough to ſettle his graciouſneſſe upon. Juſtice could not cry it down by revenge, rather then it ſhould, a ſatisfaction made by the bloud of an onely Sonne, the bloud of God and man ſhall ſtoppe the cry of it: upon this, both made by Chriſt, and taken by our Judge, lo, he turns wrath into mercy, and his boſome is ſet open and unlocked as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, 2 Cor. 5.20, 21. He offers us reconciliation, becauſe hee hath made him ſinne, and curſe, who knew none, that we might bee his righteouſneſſe.

So that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſeparate up from his love, firſt nor laſt. Thus in theſe few particulars, I have ſhewd what bottomes faith may have to cleave to a word, and to caſt herſelfe upon it for pardon and life. And ſo much for the firſt Queſtion.

               <p>And that is, why faith is called Obedience and Conſent? This queſtion ariſes from the ground of the Text: For <hi>Naaman</hi> (you ſee) being convinced by his ſervants,<note place="margin">

If ye conſent and obey, you ſhall eat the good things of the land. Hence I call faith by theſe names, only obſerve that one and the ſame faith in divers relations, hath divers names. As it relates to a command of the Goſpell, ſo its obedience: As to a perſwaſion, ſo it is conſent. As <hi>Naaman</hi> then in one act, both obeyed the command of the Prophet, and conſented to the promiſe, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion thereof; ſo doth faith obey God commanding, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to him promiſing or perſwading. This is the Commandement of God that you beleeve in his Sonne whom he hath ſent.<note place="margin">Luke 5.</note> As <hi>Peter</hi> to his Maſter, ſo faith ſaith to this command, At thy command Lord I will let downe my net, although it ſeeme never ſo abſurd. As <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> being commanded by God, went downe right, without looking at the abſurdities or objections: firſt, he would kill him, and then thinke of them, and drownd them all in the charge: ſo doth faith nakedly obey againſt all ſtops, and then caſts them upon him who ſet her on worke. So againe, ſhee conſents to his promiſe and perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:<note place="margin">Gen. 24.28.</note> Much like <hi>Rebecca</hi> having heard and ſeene <hi>Iſaacs</hi> motion and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, anſwered I will goe with the man: She ſaw enough againſt it, but the perſwaſions of <hi>Eliezer</hi> were more potent to overpoiſe her Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. So doth faith, ſhe hath a thouſand cavills and diſſwaſives; yet ſhe breakes through and conſents, and then ſhee heares no more of them. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> hearing the promiſe of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> is ſaid not to looke at <hi>Sara's</hi> wombe, which was now withered; but hee looked ſimply at the promiſe, and caſt them upon God. So that this act of faith caſting herſelfe upon the word, doth both obey nakedly the word of command, and conſents to the promiſe, as <hi>Naaman</hi> here doth to both theſe words of the Prophet, <hi>Goe waſh, and be cleane.</hi> So much alſo for this ſecond queſtion.

               <p>Againe ſecondly, this is for reproofe of ſuch Sectaries as are lately riſen up among us in ſundry places, who are ſo ſpirituall (forſooth) that the Doctrine of the condition of faith, and caſting of the Soule upon the promiſe, are beggarly elements with them; they eſteeme them carnall matters and devices of mens braine. They hold indeed there is uſe of a Law and Goſpell to tame men firſt, and then to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them: But in this Goſpell they have found out a new and more compendious courſe then others: For they ſay, there is a grace offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the promiſe by ſuch a Spirit of freedome, that it will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any bondage of the letter, nor ſuffer men to bee puzled and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled with theſe conditions of a Promiſe, nor to tye themſelves to a promiſe, and the markes or ſignes of believing. This they count baſe, and unbeſeeming ſuch a Spirit of free grace as they have found out: and therefore they ſcorn all thoſe who buſie their thoughts about ſuch workes of preparations: and tell them, they will get more comfort in an houre by the Spirit of this their free grace, then theſe lazy and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely beleevers can doe in ſeven yeares.

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there is a Spirit ſpoken of in the Goſpell, which witneſſeth to our Spirits, that we are the Lords, yet how doth it witneſſe it, ſave by the Word? Is every hearer at the firſt daſh ſo ripe and perfect, that preſently (as a fledge bird flying out of her neſt, and leaving her Damme) he can ſoare aloft in the sky, and mount up to heaven by the Spirit of aſſurance? So that he ſhall no more need any promiſe, any conditions, or markes to teſtifie the grace of God wrought in him? Put caſe that God hath ſome ſpeciall ones, to whom (after they have beleeved) he hath given the Spirit to ſeale them to the aſſurance of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?

Be heartened to truſt God who hath brought you thus far, that he will not forſake his work till it be finiſhed. Many ſtops I told you of before in the firſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine upon this verſe, which aſſault poore Chriſtians under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: I will name them no more, looke there and read them; let none of them come betweene barke and tree to defeat your faith and converſion: As once a noble man having his picture drawne faire, wrote underneath, (One thing ſtill remaines, to dye well:) So ſay you, Hitherto Lord thou haſt holpen me, and brought me under a condition of mercy; now Lord give me thy perfecting grace too, the upper and nether ſprings,<note place="margin">Judg. 1.</note> (as <hi>Caleb</hi> to <hi>Achſah</hi>) ſuffer me not now in the haven to make ſhipwracke, but give me thy hand, helpe me well over this laſt hill, that ſo I might be paſt all danger; this one thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines to ſet the faire Crowne of faith upon the ſhoulders of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition thereof, and the worke is at an end. But together with thy ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:45715:265"/> of God (for he will be ſought for it, Ezek. 36. end) quicken up thy ſpirit to looke for it, and lot upon it, that he will doe it for thee. If ſuch a one as is under the condition of the promiſe, may and ought to faſten upon the promiſe, and caſt himſelfe upon it:<note place="margin">Plead hard for faith, if once we be under the condition.</note> argue for thy ſelfe from this ground, and plead for faith as thine owne portion. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of the moſt hearers is this, That they live in a perpetuall pudder &amp; uncertainty between theſe two rocks, Whether they are under the condition or no: or if ſo, then whether they can beleeve or no. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe one thing at once: Firſt, hold thy ſelfe cloſe to the condition, if thou be under it, and let not the Divell, nor thy own feares pull thee from it. It is that portion which God hath alotted thee as a pledge of more. Theſe are the Suburbs of Hope, to bring thee into the City. Perhaps thou ſayeſt, Thou haſt nothing at all wrought in thee. As for the ſorrow and deſire which are in thee, alas! thou makeſt nothing of them, but compareſt thy ſelfe with them who have gotten beyond thee: But learne to ſay, It is mercy that I have any thing, that I breathe in the aire, that I am not in hell: But much more to enjoy a deſire after mercy. I tell thee thou mayſt plead for it: For why? Mourners for their ſinne, and thirſters for Gods favour, have a promiſe to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and ſatisfied: they want nothing ſave to beleeve it. Oh then, ſee thy priviledge, and make uſe of it!</p>
               <p>Do not ſay, The Lord may yet leave me: for I do not beleeve as yet, I may dye ere that day: Much leſſe, give place to thy ſullenneſſe, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe and diſcontent. It is ſaid of <hi>Manoahs</hi> wife, that when her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band abuſed the condition of a promiſe made unto them, and ſaid, We ſhall dye: She replied, No husband: If the Lord had meant to have ſlaine us, he would never have appeared unto us thus: and how ſhould we have a ſonne, if he ſlay us? So ſhouldſt thou argue againſt thy feares, becauſe the Lord doth nothing in vaine, therefore he will give me faith in deed. Nay, hold faſt, and cloſe to the condition, as thou wouldeſt reach the promiſe. So did <hi>Eliſha</hi> in another caſe,<note place="margin">2 Kings 2.6.</note> when <hi>Elija</hi> told him, that he had asked an hard thing, to have his Spirit doubled upon him: yet, if he ſaw him aſcending, he ſhould have it: what did he? Did he breake the condition? Did hee goe aſide, and leave his company? No, although hee were ſollicited ſtrongly to it, yet hee ſweares, As the Lord liveth, I will not leave thee till I muſt needs: For why? There lay a great iſſue upon it, the forgoing or enjoying of a double Spirit of his Maſter: Therefore to ſhew how hee cloſed with the charge at their parting, he cryed, My Father, my Father,<note place="margin">Verſe 16.</note> and ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Promiſe. So doe thou; hold that thou haſt, and let none pull it away; but by the triall of what thou haſt already got, learne to truſt God the better for that which ſtill is wanting, and ſuffer none of thy ſtaggerings to bereave thee. <hi>Eliah</hi> having tried <hi>Eliſha</hi> three or foure times to leave him, and not prevailing; lo at laſt hee granted his deſire.<note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> When that woman of Canaan had gotten a condition by the end, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt came to ſave the loſt ſheep of Iſrael, whereof ſhe (although a Dogge in account) tooke her ſelfe to bee one, and would not be beaten off by all our Saviour his buffetings, at laſt ſhee ſped: Since there is no remedy, ſaith Chriſt, but thou wilt have thy petition
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:45715:266"/> granted, take it. Sure it is, the Lord will try thee of what metall thou art made, if he meane to truſt thee with faith. If any thing will beat thee off, or make thee ſubſiſt and ſtop ere faith bee wrought in thee ſoundly: if onely a condition will ſerve thy turne, and thou art content there to reſt,<note place="margin">Judg. 6.</note> thou art not fit for Gods battell. Even as God tried the lappers of water from the ſoopers of it, for <hi>Gedeon:</hi> ſo will he try thee. Be wiſe therefore, and ſo hold the condition, as yet underſtanding, that the excellency thereof ſtands rather in her relation, then in her ſelfe: for if it could be, that faith might be ſevered from deſire or ſorrow, it were not poſſible for thee to be happy. But to ſever them in the elect, it is not poſſible. And thus much may ſerve to have ſpoken of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the doctrine, to wit, the condition of a promiſe, and the uſes thereof.

Tell us not (ſay they) of ſuch ſpirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as theſe, they are above our reach and capacity: wee are plaine folke, commit not ſuch riddles to us, we forget them as faſt: we love ſuch things as we ſee, feele, taſte, and handle: If yee will tell us a tale, or play a jigge, or ſhew us a play and fine ſights, or ſing ſonnets in our eares, if you will bring us to merry company, or a feaſt, if you will ſhew us ſome new faſhion, or if you will helpe us to a good bargaine, where we may put out our money to uſe, for eight in the hundred, or tell us of a warme match for my Sonne or Daughter: if you will ſhew us how we may get the day of our adverſary, or if you can tell us of ſome curious project for gaine; or but talke with us about our corne, or croppe of hoppes: theſe have ſome tack and ſavour in them: there we will be for you: Or if to drinke and ſwagger all day and night at the pot, or Tobacco, have at you: theſe things taſte with us, here you have us tied by the ſenſe, and carnall wit can reach them: But alas! we know not what you meane when you ſpeake of ſuch high learning, as to caſt our ſelves upon the Word for pardon.

               <p>As it was with thoſe Iſraelites, Exod. 32. This <hi>Moſes</hi> our ſpirituall man (ſay they) is gone up to God in the mount, he is too heavenly a creature for us, we love to ſee our God, and to kiſſe him, and dance before him, to feaſt and be merry, and ſo doing, we are content to thanke him for our deliverance out of Egypt; even ſuch an one art thou: Thou loveſt Religion too, perhaps thou art an ace beyond them I ſpake of; But thou wouldeſt have it ſtand in thine owne way to be a morall civill man, to follow thy trade, to pay every man his owne, to give almes to the poore, to love devotion, to keepe thy Church, and live in the Towne as a good neighbour: This we love, and feele ſome bottome in it too: But as for caſting our ſelves upon a bare word of God, or making that a reall foundation for our ſoules to reſt upon: God helpe us, we know not how to feele our feet under us; you ſeem to bid us hang in the aire, and to ſubſiſt upon nothing.

If thy ſenſe were not left-handed, thou mightſt with thy right hand beare downe thy infidelity; for God hath given aſſurance ſufficient by his Sonne unto thy very ſenſe, if thou wert not brutiſh?

Ah poore wretch! is not he able to provide thee earth by his word, who thereby hath purchaſed heaven for thee? Is there nothing but the creature, the creature which will down with thee?

Are not theſe juſt plagues of old unbeleefe? Doe not men upon their death beds, cry out, It is juſt with God thus to handle me, for I never could truſt him, nor his word, further then I ſaw, felt and taſted him! Oh, God hath met with you! Did he not threaten the deſpiſers of his Law with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of heart, with hanging by the eye-lids, an heart of heavineſſe &amp; ſorrow, ſaying in the morning, would God it were evening, &amp; in the evening, would it were morning! Read Deut. 29. that roll of curſes; what anguiſh of heart, fears &amp; perplexities the Lord threatens to ſend upon ſuch as applauded themſelves in their rotten peace, and the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneneſſe of their unbeleefe? Surely we may thinke then, its juſter to ſmite them that have abuſed his Goſpell with ſpirituall penalties, making a ſcourge of their owne cords! And yet all this will not ſerve to drive men out of their prophaneneſſe, and dallying with the word; ſtill they will cavill againſt faith, and ſay, Tuſh, theſe men of the Spirit would have all men like to themſelves; but we cannot bee ſo heavenly, our time is not yet come, when God will it ſhall be, and
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:45715:267"/> till then, tis but folly for us to ſtruggle, we will doe what lies in us, and put our helping hand to Gods, and then hope the beſt. Others tell the Miniſter, they thinke it is impoſſible for any to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy in this life; or if it be not, yet it is very difficult, or very unlikely: Oh ſay they, we cannot forgoe ſuch a luſt, or ill cuſtome; and this faith will bereave us of all our ſweet pleaſures and liberties; we ſhall never have done with it, if we once beginne, others come by it eaſilyer then we, we are dull ſchollers: poore men muſt doe as they may, and cannot follow this learning ſo hard, our buſineſſe and worke hinder us, and our memories are ſhallow, we ſee theſe belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are as little ſet by among men as any, a thouſand of theſe baſe cavills men have.

               <p>A ſecond Uſe is Inſtruction, to teach us the moſt pretious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> nature and prerogative of faith. For the nature of it,<note place="margin">Inſtruction 1. Branch. The nature of Faith is moſt pretious. 1 Pet. 1.8.</note> wee ſee this only, and no other grace is allotted the ſoule for this end, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten and take hold upon the Word and Promiſe: As the Word is the only thing which beares witneſſe unto us of good, and his way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, (for we ſee nothing, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes, yet beleeve) ſo, the onely gift to caſt the ſoule upon this word is faith. And therefore it is the off-ſpring of God, that grace which hath the birthright of all the reſt, and is the <hi>Reuben</hi> and ſtrength of God, ſuch a one as if the Lord would even ſtudy how to dwell with us, and in us,<note place="margin">Prov. 8.31.</note> (as wiſdome ſaith in the Proverbs, She delights to inhabit with men) yea, how to make us partakers of the divine nature, and reſtore his Image in us, he could not doe it by any other ſo excellent a grace, as by this of faith: Therefore Eſay 57. its called the creation of God,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.2 3.</note> (I create the fruit of the lips, peace; if the daughter, peace, then much more the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Faith:) its that grace which onely can ſay as <hi>Iob</hi> did,<note place="margin">Job 23.12.</note> I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the words of his mouth; it counts one word or promiſe of God as a deed done; for faith is, when that is done which is ſpoken, it gives a realneſſe and being to the word and promiſe: and as you ſee a mould preſently faſhions the mettall according to it ſelf, juſt like it; and as the ſeale printing upon the ſoft wax leaves that impreſſion upon it, which it beares it ſelfe: even ſo it is with faith, it faſhions it ſelfe according to the mould of the word, and beares the ſame ſtampe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, which the ſeale of the word bare: looke upon the one, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:45715:268"/> the other. Nay its the inſtrument of the Spirit, without which it workes not. As <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Iſhai</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> ſend for him, for wee can doe nothing till he come: So till faith come into the ſoule to bee the organ of the Spirit, to worke in us by it, alas, the Spirit is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to our ſoules! Its that coale from the Altar wherewith the Lord touches and inſpires the ſoule; the ſoule is the life of the body, and faith is the ſoule and life of the ſoule, cauſing it ſo much to excell it ſelfe, as an Angel doth a man. Briefly, the word is a dead letter to us, if faith make it not a powerfull word, a word of life in us. Its that which cauſeth out of the belly of the ſoule (even as water from a ſpring) to flow rivers of waters of eternall life;<note place="margin">John 7.38.</note> even of peace through pardon and of joy unſpeakable and glorious.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.8. 2 Pet. 1.2.3.</note> By it as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, Moſt great and pretious promiſes are given to us: ſo that if that hand that taketh rich gifts be a pretious hand, then ſurely ſo is faith which only receives the gift of Chriſt, and all he hath, and hoardeth them in the ſoule: That Chriſt Eph. 3.14. may dwell in your heart by faith: That you may comprehend all love, even the length, depth, and all dimenſions thereof (as fleſh here is able to doe) as all Saints doe: ſaith the Apoſtle. No other grace is ordained to this end, ſave this: It was the inſtrument of receiving Chriſt into the wombe of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, by which all generations ſhould call her bleſſed, and ſo it is ſtill the ſame ſpiritually,<note place="margin">Luke 1.38. ver. 48. Prov. 31.29.</note> and therefore may ſay as <hi>Mary</hi> did, The Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath magnified me above all my fellow graces. Many daughters have done well, but thou haſt excelled them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Branch. Prerogative of Faith.</note>And ſecondly, the prerogative of faith is ſutable to her nature: for although many things are very pretious in nature, as jewells which excell in luſtre and brightneſſe, which yet equall not the price with any reall uſe;<note place="margin">Job 28.19.</note> yet this pretious grace is as uſefull alſo, and therefore well might <hi>Salomon</hi> ſay, and ſo <hi>Iob</hi> alſo, She is more pretious then Rubies, and the Topaz of Ethiopia ſhall not bee taken for her. And that appeares by this, that ſhe is the doer of all in all in the ſoule, both for light,<note place="margin">In ſundry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</note> direction and ſtrength. Firſt, for light: as the Sunne is firſt ſubject of naturall light in the world: So is Faith in the ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> divine light in the ſoule. And is to the whole man as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpeakes of the eye, if it be light, then is the whole body light, the hand,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.22.</note> the foote, the members are all light, if the eye be cleare. And as the Ephod or Urim were to the Prieſt, ſo is faith to the ſoule, even the oracle of it, and conceives the deep things of God, and reveals them to us, to whom before they were hidden. And if it be true (as its moſt true) that we know no more in Gods matters then wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; then ſurely faith is the key of all true and ſaving knowledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in the ſoule. Then alſo ſhe is the directreſſe of the ſoule. As ſervants from the Maſter or Miſtreſſe; ſo doe all the graces of the Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive direction from the gift of faith. As in a ſhip each boy hath his taske, ſome to row with oares in the boat, others to climb the ſhreeds, to pumpe, to ſtop the leaks, ſome to attend the ſteridge, but all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive direction from the boatſwaine, he orders them and their works: So Faith workes not every thing immediately in the frame of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, ſhe hath abundance of workemen: and as the Centurion ſaid to
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:45715:268"/> his, ſo Faith ſaith to hers, Doe this, ſuffer this, conquer this, come, goe, and they all obey. If a croſſe come; goe Patience, endure it: If a bleſſing; come Sobriety, uſe it temperately, as if thou didſt not uſe it: If any duty of mercy to ſoule or body to be done, Charity and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality muſt doe them: If any hard taske, then Wiſedome, Diligence, or Selfe-deniall muſt ſtep forth: and to theſe Faith gives their charge, and orders their worke. Thirdly, ſhe is the ſtrength of all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the Spirit. As all ſinewes are from the braine, all Arteries from the heart, all veines from the liver, thence they derive their originall, and all that activity which they exerciſe in the body: So,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.9.</note> all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit fetch their being and ſupport from Faith: Shee is the ſeed of God in the Soule, and ſhe is the ſtrength of God alſo. His ſeed, becauſe whatſoever divineneſſe is in the gift of patience, long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, thankfulneſſe, mercy, love, hope of ſalvation, it comes from the fountaine of Faith. She is the Merchant Royall, &amp; all other Chapmen have their wares from her Store-houſe. Then ſhe is the ſtrength alſo of God in all graces. Whatſoever thou ſeeſt excellent in a Chriſtians frame or graces, if thou hadſt an eye to ſee, thou ſhouldſt behold them all in one faith: out of whole Forge and Anvill they are all formed.</p>
               <p>For why? Faith taking hold of Gods maine ſtrength to ſave, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries away all his ſtrength to obey: if God will ſave me, ſurely hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves my love, my patience: and ſurely hee and his love will put mee forth, and uphold me in doing for him, in curbing my paſſions, in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying my Giant-like corruptions, the great ſonnes of <hi>Anak,</hi> thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mims and Zanzummims,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.8. Eſay 26.12.</note> which are above all the reſt in fierceneſſe and ſtrength. So that now mark, this Doctrine of Faith, caſting the Soule upon the Word and Promiſe for pardon and life, argues the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent nature and prerogative of faith above all other. It is evident by this, whatſoever the Lord workes in man, he workes by the Word and the Spirit: and whatſoever theſe two act in the ſoule, they act it by faith, as their onely inſtrument: ſo that Faith is the onely Intelligencer to the Soule, from the Spirit and from Heaven: and that grace which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is maintained as agent for God in the ſoul. No other gift is ſo. As hee ſaith of the ſhip, that there are in it, many who do needfull works, but the Pilot doth all in all: he doth not ſo ſordid works as they, but he doth greater and better: for he ſits at the ſterne, and guides the courſe of the Ship into the Haven: the other are but ſubordinate, but ſhee is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall: ſo I may ſay of Faith and other graces, all of them conferre to the well-being of a Chriſtian; but faith to the being. The Ship boyes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ſtop leakes, and row with Oares, but they doe not the great worke of guiding the Ship by Card and Compaſſe, till ſhe come at land: So all that which any grace of the Spirit doth, that faith doth: But faith doth ſomewhat which they doe not, nor can doe: Nay, faith is faine to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the defects of other graces, to ſave them harmleſſe, and to beare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> their chin above water from ſinking. As we ſee that the Shield is not onely armour to fence the body,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.16.</note> but alſo to fence off blowes and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts from all the armour it ſelfe, ſo that the dint come not at the head-peece, or corſlet, or the reſt. Onely faith brings the Lord Jeſus into the ſoule, to doe all her workes in her, and for her; and when
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:45715:269"/> all is done, to pardon the wants, and to cleanſe away the ſpots thereof, by cloathing her with that robe, under which God ſeeth no deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to impute or puniſh it. To conclude, I ſay (brethren) that I preſſe this purpoſely, that as I have ſpoken much of thoſe things (in this Book) which tend to faith: ſo, I would perſwade you to thinke no paines too great to beſtow in the getting thereof; becauſe this grace being once gotten, to caſt the ſoule upon the Word and Promiſe; yea, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in Chriſt. By this meane, ſhe hath all, becauſe ſhe encloſeth him who is all in all: in whom are hidden all the treaſures of wiſdome, who is the fulneſſe of God, in whom we are complete. And ſo much may ſerve for this uſe.</p>

Faith hath two parts. 1. Self denial.</note> by ſhewing you of what ingredients the receit is made, or of what parcels it conſiſts. And they are two: The former, deniall of our ſelves: The latter, reſigning up of the ſoule to Gods Word. For, to caſt the ſoule upon the promiſe, implies both theſe. Selfe-deniall then firſt, is one parcell of this grace: For why? It is impoſſible that the ſoule ſhould caſt it ſelfe upon a Word, till ſhe have caſt off all weights and clogges, which might hold backe and with-draw her from this free and full giving up her ſelfe to God.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> I make this plaine by a ſimilitude: A Clergie man hath a Benefice, which by his errour is fallen into the lapſe: if hee will ſtill plead a true right by his preaching of his Sermons, or ſerving Cure, he loſeth his living, or if his ſtomacke be too great to confeſſe the lapſe. But if he will acknowledge his lapſe, and have his friend ready in the Court to begge it of the King, to whom it is fallen, hee may poſſibly ſave the lapſe, and recover his living with a better title then at firſt. So here, Grace is fallen into the lapſe, by <hi>Adams</hi> and thy ſinne: by this the right of it is forfeit into the hand of the King of heaven: if thou wilt now confeſſe the forfeit, and renounce thy crazie title, if thou wilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne it up into the Kings hand, going to thy friend the Lord Jeſus to begge it for thee againe, thou mayſt have it better confirmed then ever. Elſe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if thou plead thine owne righteouſneſſe, thou loſeſt Gods. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Simile: As it is in the marriage union, A woman cannot wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne up herſelfe to a man, except ſhe wholly be free from all her own cavils and exceptions which might hinder her reſolution. If either her minde ſtand to live a virgin (as diſtaſting the married eſtate in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall:) or if ſhe like it, but yet refuſe, except ſhee may have her owne ends, reſerve ſtroke in her owne hand, to diſpoſe of that ſhe hath, or have ſuch and ſuch liberties, to goe and doe as her liſteth: or if ſhee feele the yoke of ſubjection heavie to her, and will be eaſed of it: or if ſhe diſlike the perſon or qualities of the party, or his abilities, or breed &amp; parentage, or trade &amp; calling: any of theſe are ſufficient to hold her ſpirit off, and to uſe her freedome, &amp; live ſingle: Even ſo here: Till Self and ſelfe-ends be all borne down by the ſtreame of grace and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, there is no poſſibility for the ſoule to yeeld up her ſelfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne her liberty. That which they ſpeake in Joh. 8.33. Wee are <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> children, &amp; were never bound unto any, is the voyce of every baſe heart: which though it ly in the deepeſt ſlavery, yet thinkes her
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:45715:269"/> ſelfe free: becauſe that chaine is ſweet by cuſtome, and becomes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as deere as life it ſelfe: And to bee broken off from it, is more bitter then death. Oh! every one thinkes thus,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.9.</note> Now I am alive to my will and luſts: If once my necke bee under the coller of Chriſt, I muſt ſtoope; farewell then all my liberty. But till the ſoule bee brought to ſee that in the promiſe which will equall ſuch carnall liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and recompence them with an hundred fold in a better kinde, ſhee will never be perſwaded to deny her ſelfe. Shee ſees her ſelfe warme in her neſt, feeles no want, loves her eaſe, and therefore will not out of her track.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, Pſal. 45.<note place="margin">To be brought to an utter ſtrait, and a forlorne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is one ingredient of faith.</note> that <hi>Salomon</hi> tells <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> daughter (in the name of the Church) that if ſhee will forget her ſelfe, her Idols, and heatheniſh heart, her fathers houſe and contents, her private wealth and honour, that ſhe may wholly bee his, and according to his heart, in her prizing him for himſelfe, and for his meere love, above all other delights: if ſhe will bee ſubject to him, and deny her owne name and will, then ſhe ſhould bee a wife for him, and hee would delight in her love, not elſe: So, that reſigning up her ſelfe wholly to bee at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, was one maine peece of the marriage. Even ſo is it here, That ſoule which will enter league with God, and caſt her ſelfe upon him for pardon and life, muſt wholly ceaſe to be her owne, and come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both the name and authority of another, or elſe ſhee equivocates and lies to the holy Ghoſt, worſe then <hi>Ananias</hi> did. Firſt, that averſe heart in generall to the match, muſt be taken off; that contrariety and diſtaſte of converſion and Chriſtianity, muſt be abandoned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rebellion againſt the way of God muſt be abhorred: then all quarrels againſt God, the conditions of a regenerate perſon, the difficulties, the croſſes annexed to it, muſt bee devoured. All the ſoules mixtures, both in the way of beleeving, and obedience afterward, muſt bee pared away. All her owne duties, performances, labours, zeale, devotion, religion, morality, all her affections bred in her from her owne ends, muſt bee forfeit: She muſt be content that Grace honour her ſelfe with the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtroke in the worke of converſion: if ſhe beare not all the ſway, ſhe will beare none at all. Now if any of theſe ſticke in her ſtomacke, if ſhe be willing to have the fat and ſweet, but ſhee will have none of the ſoure: ſhe is ſtill within her owne bounds, and cannot freely reſigne up her ſelfe to the promiſe: for Selfe and the Word are directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. No ſoule will caſt her ſelfe upon a bare word of God, but that which hath firſt renounced all that might really give her content with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. And therefore (to finiſh) ſuch a ſoule puts her ſelfe out of her owne diſpoſe, and ſubmits her ſelfe to be at the diſpoſe of God, to doe with her as he pleaſes, according to that which in his word hee hath revealed himſelfe to be willing to doe. She deſires that ſhe might bee more willing to have God glorified in his owne way, and honoured in his mercy, then to enjoy pardon and heaven in her owne way. And although it bee not the caſe of every weake ſoule to come thus farre, becauſe that which drawes the ſoule firſt to ſeeke God, is her owne pinch of guilt and curſe, and her deſire of forgiveneſſe &amp; peace: yet her entire deſire is, to caſt her ſelfe ſo farre upon the bare word of God,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:45715:270"/> that if that can faile, ſhe is willing to periſh: and as ſhe growes in light and ſtrength, ſhe is glad to be informed what the ſcope and purpoſe of any truth of God is; and being ſo, ſhee deſires to ſtoop to it moſt humbly and entirely, that (whatſoever become of her owne) yet Gods will may be done in her and by her. And this may ſerve briefly to ſhew what the firſt part of faith imports, that is, Selfe-deniall. I have oft ſpoken of it before. Thus much here may ſerve.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2 Part. Reſignation. Reſigning up of the ſoule to God, is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of faith.</note>The ſecond thing in faith is, Reſignation of her ſelfe to God. This is, when God is fully and wholly that unto the ſoule, which before Selfe was, or any thing in the world wherein her content ſtood. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider (good brethren) I ſpeake of a weighty thing, and not for diſcourſe ſake: Perhaps you may thinke I goe to deepe, and indeed ſo I doe, for a carnall fleet heart; howbeit no truth of God muſt bee concealed to pleaſe our baſeneſſe: therefore to caſt and reſigne up the ſoule to God, is neither more nor leſſe then to lot upon the Lord in the promiſe, to become that unto the Soule, which before Selfe and the world was in the uttermoſt of her profits and pleaſures, luſts and vanities, which gave her that ſatisfaction which ſhe deſired. Oh (good friends) that neither I nor you might utter and heare that in a few ſentences, which perhaps all our life hath ſcarcely reacht unto: For, I tell you plainly, ſuch a ſpeech as this, might well ſet us both upon ſcanning how the caſe ſtands with us. Wee all know what our owne ends, what the world,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.16. Matth. 18.9.</note> the pleaſures of it, the luſt of the heart, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life, have been unto us: Surely, as our eye and right hand.<note place="margin">When as God is to the Soule that which formerly Selfe and ſin were, it is a ſigne of reſignation to God.</note> Tell me now: Are any of us ſo caſt upon the word of God and thoſe qualities of a promiſe before named, faithfulneſſe, conſtancy, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingneſſe, freedome, and the reſt, that wee can venture all our welfare thereon? That God will ſo alſufficiently ſupply us, that both all our former unlawfull liberties and contents, ſhall bee as meere loſſe and dung to us, and wee ſhall think our ſelves never the worſe? Againe, that all meet and lawful contents ſhall be miniſtred unto us, and that by a promiſe? Laſtly, that if ought bee denied us, which may ſeeme deſirable, wee ſhall therefore not thinke it meet, becauſe God gives it not (for elſe his love could beteame it) and if wee muſt want it, yet even therein we ſhall abound; becauſe wee have his promiſe, that it ſhall bee an hundred for one; Yea, and that wee ſhall eſteeme the preſence of God, his favour, peace of heart in forgoing a bleſſing, or patience in bearing a croſſe, greater gaine (by farre) then to have had our wills in kinde? Truly (brethren) to have God that unto us which before other things were, is not leſſe then I have ſpoken: and yet ſo is God to that poore ſoule which hath caſt her ſelfe upon him for pardon and life: for hee who will not faile in the greateſt, will not faile in the ſmaller. Marke then, Faith in caſting her ſelfe upon the promiſe, is an hard grace, but yet wiſe: ſhee will loſe nothing in the Hundred, but ſhee will get in the Shire: and ſhe is warranted ſo to doe by the Lord, who will have her know, if ſhe will be ruled by him, and truſt his word, ſhe ſhall be no loſer, but an infinite gainer; yea, and know it alſo, to her great content, though now and then mixt with ſome doubtings and weakneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="501" facs="tcp:45715:270"/>
               <p>And by this meane the ſoule waxes confident upon God in the promiſe, and by degrees growes to ſee this truth as well in other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, as in the maine: of which I ſhall after ſay ſomewhat. I ſay, faith growes by experience to an holy complacence in God by his promiſe, to be all one with him, acquainted with his truth and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to venture herſelfe and all her happineſſe thereon, and ſo to have ſuch an affiance, and truſt in God, as not eaſily to be unſettled by each deluſion, or conceit of Sathan, or world, or herſelfe: But ſtill in all her ſeeming ſtraits and difficulties to rely upon the promiſe, and to picke out the true meaning thereof, even the length and depth of it; and ſeeing God cannot lye, therefore to wait for reſolution in all doubtfull caſes, rather then raſhly to queſtion the promiſe, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent her of her choice. This holy obedientiall affiance and truſt upon God by a promiſe, is that happineſſe of a Chriſtian ſoule, and that true reſt of heart which ſhe ſhould pitch herſelfe upon, as that portion which ſhe counts beſt, an fallen into a goodly ground. It is a good illuſion which <hi>Saloman</hi> or <hi>Batſheba</hi> hath, Prov. 31.11. of the good wife, That the heart of an husband reſts in her, hee is ſo linckt in love and affection to her, ſo experienced in her fidelity, chaſtity, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and gracefulneſſe, that his heart reſts upon her, and truſts to her: Be the buſineſſe never ſo weighty, be he never ſo farre diſtant from her, let never ſuch conceits and ſuſpitions come in his minde, all are waſht off, the truſt which hee hath in her quits his minde, and hee reſts upon her without caſting any ſcruples. May it bee ſo betweene ſinfull couples, who may be and are in many things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull, and ſhall not the Lord much more be truſted? Yes doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: A true beleeving ſoule goes not to worke by gueſſe, caſts not with herſelfe, what if God ſhould faile her? What if ſhe ſhould bee defeated? But becauſe the promiſe hath ſecured her of Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable truth, ſhe takes it,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> and (as with a knife) cuts in two all ſuch cords of withdrawing feares, and throwes herſelfe upon it; as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor is caſt upon the bottome under water, when once the Pilot hath by his plummet ſounded it, and there it ſticks, and holds the ſhip from toſſing too and fro with winde and waves; even ſo doth the ſoule which hath known the Lord, and taken ſure markes of him, knit and faſten it ſelfe upon him, and ſtands not to deſcant off and on, this way and that, but drownes it ſelf once for all in the ſea of his Attributes, no more to be diſtempered by any of her objections. That time which others ſpend in asking, Shall I? Shall I? I could be content, but may I ſafely doe it, and ſhall I be welcome? With the like ſtuffe ſhee ſpends in doing as ſhe is bidden,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.

Somewhat I ſaid about ſuch lets in the firſt Doctrine upon this verſe: Some of more ſpeciall marke in this kinde I have reſerved to this place, which I will ſumme up in few words.</p>
               <p>Firſt, reſt not in making many complaints touching thy backward and averſe heart from caſting thy ſelfe upon the word: I doe not bid thee ceaſe complaining, for the Church hath none to moane her, ſave him to whom ſhe complaines. <hi>Ieremy</hi> Cap. 3. brings in <hi>Iuda</hi> complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but withall ſhe returnes to God and faith, Thou art the Lord our God, and <hi>Ephraim</hi> complaines. Jer. 31.33. but withall ſhe is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Lord calls her his firſt borne, ſo Eſay 63. The Church in Babell ſadly mournes for the hiding of Gods face, but ſhee is reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe till 64.1.<note place="margin">Eſay 34. Eſter 2.5.</note> the Lord make the mountaines melt and flow downe that he may helpe her. So doe thou, and proſper. Mourne like <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechia,</hi> like a Crane or Dove, but joine his faith to it, and ſay, Hee hath ſaid it, and will doe it. Mourne like <hi>Eſter,</hi> ſo thou doe as <hi>Eſter,</hi> goe into the King, and touch the Scepter, ſaying, I will caſt my ſelfe upon the promiſe, if I perſh there, ſo be it. But elſe as for many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to men who are like thy ſelfe, for faſhion, fruitleſſely, and there reſt, without cleaving to the anſwer of thy complaints, &amp; taking counſell; I ſay bite them in, and keepe them to the Lord and thy ſelf in ſecret; for they may puffe thee up with pride and falſe opinion of thy ſelfe, defile thee and harden thee, and hurt others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, beware of ſloth and dalliance with the Lord, but when the Lord comes neare thee, doe not make thy ſelfe ſure before thou haſt it, and ſo neglect the purſuit and accompliſhment of it, follow him cloſe at the heeles, and ſuffer him not to put thee off, but let him ſee thou art minded to buy and not to cheapen: all commodities have their peculiar ſeaſon to get them in, and ſo hath faith; diſcerne this ſeaſon of the Son of man, thou canſt not make it earlier or later then God makes it, onely marke his day and houre, and make ſure of it then. If the Lord ſee thee to be a pedling chapman, either he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it thee wholy, or cauſe thine eaſe to vex every veine in thy heart ere thou have it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, take heed of filling thine heart and thoughts with earthly things; the cares for earth will eat in ſo dangerouſly, and winne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee as the ſea tydes gull downe the bankes: They will eat up cares of heaven, as they ſay Eagles feathers will conſume other fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being mixed with them. Be ſure if thou lay in for faith, come with an heart empty of other thoughts: if thou wouldeſt caſt thy ſelf
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:45715:271"/> upon a promiſe, throw not thy ſelfe upon the world, and the contents of it. I ſpeake not of the corrupt world, but of the moſt lawfull li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties; they are apt to ſteale away thy ſpirit eaſilieſt under that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: marke thy ſelfe if ever the promiſe were more favourleſſe to thy taſte, then when the world is ſweeteſt: Be aſhamed to plunge thy ſelf into the creature, when thou pretendeſt a deſire to caſt thy ſelfe upon the word for pardon and life.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and above all, let no bitter roote defile thine heart,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.15.</note> and ſpring up to choake thy reſolution this way. It will over droppe all thy purpoſes and mar them. Pride, prejudice, luſt, covetouſneſſe, pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vy looſeneſſe which the heart will not bee beaten from, any other naughtineſſe will ſo appall and defile the pure gift of faith that it will not come neare where ſuch haunt: Take heed of ſuffering any luſt to get head and overflow knowledge; let not an hollow heart not throughly ſearched, but preſumed to be better then it is, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againe after long violent ſuppreſſion, enter in to deſtroy all thy faire hopes; for as ſweet as it is in thy mouth, it will prove gall to thee at laſt, as <hi>Eſau's</hi> prophaneneſſe did, but too late.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, beware of curioſity and ſelf-willedneſſe in Gods way: But humbly trade with him in it, be content with the conditions of his market, both for time and takings: Be not offended at any affronts which befall thee, but ſubmit to his will from whom thou lookeſt for thy cure. If <hi>Naaman</hi> had done thus, he had caſt himſelfe upon Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den without all this adoe: But becauſe thou wilt frame an Idea to thy ſelfe how thou wouldeſt proceed, and canſt abide no prolongings, no croſſings of thy courſe, becauſe thou art not alway alike in thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but ſometime under hatches, ſometimes in the top ſailes, thou art impatient, and comeſt ſhort of thy deſires. Submit to him who tries all that is in thine heart, that at laſt by thy oft defeats, thou maieſt know,<note place="margin">Deut. 8.2. Rom. 9.16.</note> It is not in the willer nor runner, but in him who ſheweth mercy, at whoſe curteſie its meet thou ſtand with all ſubmiſſion, till he have ſubdued thee to himſelfe, and made thee (with <hi>Naaman</hi>) glad to obey and waſh in the Jorden of the Promiſe. Thus much of theſe: like to which are many more, but by theſe judge of the reſt, and caſt off all, if thou wouldſt caſt thy ſelfe upon the promiſe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, this is Exhortation to all who are under the Condition, <label type="milestone">

By minding it, I meane a marking of it, an heeding of it as a thing of no ordinary excellency: Count it as thou wouldeſt the chaire of Eſtate which thou boweſt unto, as repreſenting the Kings perſon. So doth the promiſe, its the chamber of preſence, in which God diſcovers himſelfe, the royall Chaire which carries State in it; when thou beholdeſt it, behold in it the Majeſty of God,<note place="margin">Eſay 26.10.</note> which no hypocrite can ſee in it: Its hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from his eye: but to a beleever, ſet by God in the clift of the rocke,<note place="margin">Exod. 34.6.</note> thence to ſee the glory of God, his graciouſneſſe, and to heare all his good proclaimed: to ſuch an one the promiſe is of a moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent excellency,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. end</note> full of all the fulneſſe of God. Slight it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but ſet thy marke upon it. Secondly, ponder it, as <hi>Mary</hi> did; weigh well the contents of it, the bleſſed conſequences of beleeving: Take to conſideration the worth of the pearle,<note place="margin">Luke. 1.29.</note> and treaſure hid in the field, as that wiſe Merchant did, Matth. 12.44. Its as the applying of <hi>Ebed melecs</hi> rags under <hi>Ieremies</hi> armeholes,<note place="margin">Jer. 38.11.</note> that he might be drawne out with eaſe. Meditation is an heavenly trading of the ſoule in her thoughts and affections with Gods matters till the ſoule clapſe with them.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> Thirdly, make the promiſe familiar by this means. Draw thine heart to it, make it thy familiar friend and counſellor to paſſe all thy matters for thee, and in all thy doubts, conſult with it, and let that give ſentence: And having received it, eſteem the words of the mouth of it as <hi>Iob</hi> did,<note place="margin">Job 23.12.</note> above thy appointed food; powre all into the boſome of it, as thou wouldſt powre out the ſymptomes of thy diſeaſe into the boſome of thy Phyſitian, or a child all her griefes, loſſes, and ſorrows into the lap of a tender mother. Thou ſhalt fare better by a promiſe, then they ſhall doe at their hands. This is the firſt direction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, be under the authority and evidence of a promiſe, and be convinced by it that its thine; that all before ſaid of the ſtrength, wiſdome &amp; other properties of a promiſe, do belong to thee as really, and are put into it by God, that thou mightſt have thy part in them. See clearly as in a mirror, that God intends all to thy ſelfe, and as in the Covenant more generally, ſo in the Seales more particularly. As <hi>Laban</hi> ſeeing how ſtrangely things went,<note place="margin">Gen. 24 50.</note> ſaid, We can ſay neither more nor leſſe, but Gods finger is here, it muſt be a match. This is the work of the Spirit of the promiſe alway aſſiſting it, and telling the ſoule under the Condition Doubtleſſe, thou art the party whom God means to ſave:<note place="margin">Eſter 6.6.</note> As <hi>Haman</hi> ſaid, whom ſhould the King mean ſave me? So ſhalt thou ſay, (but much more warrantably) If God had not in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:45715:272"/> meant me well, he would never have ſo convinced me, and ſet me on ground, that I ſhould have nothing to gainſay. The Judge on the bench ſaw not the theefe ſteale, but by the ſworne evidences of witneſſes he is ſo convinced in himſelfe, that he reads ſentence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion; by this meanes the ſoule brings out Gods cloake, ſtaffe and ſignet as his pledges left in her hand to aſſure her of his good meaning toward her.<note place="margin">Gen. 38.25.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, claſpe unto, and with the promiſe cleave unto it, to bee rid of all thy annoyances at once. Once convinced of the promiſe, and ever faſtned to it. And this cleaving to it is that worke which immediately cauſeth the conſent, and obedience of the ſoule unto it, to caſt it ſelf upon the promiſe, open it thus: The ſoule in the act of beleeving, is ſollicited by Satan and unbeleefe, to give over, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to folly: But the promiſe preſſing in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perſwades her to beleeve and renounce her old diſtempers: The ſoule in this demurre conſults with herſelfe thus, If I goe backward, I periſh irrecoverably: If I go forward, I ſee difficulty, yet hope. What then ſhall I doe? Surely I cannot be worſe then I am: I muſt dye however in not beleeving; but in beleeving, I may live: Therefore I will caſt my ſelf upon the promiſe and live. A man will doe thus naturally, though he have no promiſe: Thus did thoſe 9. lepers, 2 King. 3. only upon an hazard, they caſt themſelves upon the army of the Aramites: Why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſure to dye in the City. So the poore ſoule giving herſelfe for dead, puts her life in her hand, and ſaith, worſe then dead I cannot be; better I may be by a promiſe: Nay, if God be true, I ſhall be; and therefore I will venture my ſoule, and jeopard all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods faithfulneſſe, if I periſh, I periſh in the armes of a promiſe, not in Satans clawes, and by my unbeleefe. In this ſtrife of the ſoule, the Spirit doth lay in ſuch ſtrong weights of perſwaſion againſt the diſſwaſives of corruption, that the ſoule finally is overruled, and ſo conſents and obeyes to caſt herſelfe upon the ſure bottome of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for pardon and life.</p>
               <p>By theſe directions thou maiſt helpe thy ſelfe in this weighty worke; but becauſe the heart is dull upon the ſpurre,<note place="margin">Motives to Faith.</note> let me adde a few motives to quicken thee. Let one be this, Remember firſt, that this will be the iſſue of Gods enquiry at his comming to judgement. Secondly, that by this reſigning up the ſoule to God, the greateſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is done to him which by a mortall creature can be. Thirdly, that all ſuch in the day of the Lord ſhall be moſt glorious. Fourthly, that the greateſt wrath and vengeance ſhall light upon the heads of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers. Fifthly, that this being the rareſt grace of all others in the world, is therefore worth our chiefeſt endeavour. Of theſe and the like I purpoſe (God willing) to treat of the next Lecture. Now for the preſent (having exceeded our ordinary bounds) we will deſiſt here. Let us pray.</p>

                     </gap>ves moſt glory to God.</note> gives moſt glory to God: therefore it is worth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing while we have time. I thinke none will deny, but that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes moſt to God, and leaſt to man, is the moſt worthy grace to lay in for. But ſuch is this: It is wholly for God, concurres with him in this point of his honour above all. All our obedience to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law, at once conſidered, glorifies not God ſo much as this: no, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we could performe it exactly, as wee cannot. Partly, becauſe this grace apprehends the perfection of Gods righteouſneſſe, which no holineſſe or righteouſneſſe can reach to. Faith (though weake) yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the perfection of God, and thereby conformes us to bee like him. Now thats a great honour to God, to reſemble his perfection, and to be perfectly righteous, which only faith in this life apprehends. Partly alſo, for that faith onely acknowledges God in all thoſe Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of his, whereby he ſets forth himſelfe in the ſaving of his elect. God aimed at more glory in Redemption, then in Creation: And <hi>Adam</hi> did not ſo much honour God in his integrity, as a beleever doth in the act of his faith: For <hi>Adam</hi> honoured Goodneſſe, but not Juſtice nor Mercy, which the Lord meant eſpecially to ſet forth in Chriſt. Read
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:45715:273"/> Read Rom. 3.25.26. Oh! you may eaſily conceive, how acceptable this work of faith is to God, by a reſemblance: For take an ambitious man, who ſtands more upon his honour then gaine: Who doth moſt pleaſe ſuch a man? Hee that ſends him gifts? No, he ſeeks to have all men bound to him, rather then to be obliged to any. That man is for his tooth, who in great meetings trumpets out his praiſe, tells of his breed, learning, bounty, and generouſneſſe: And if any leſſen his praiſe by compariſon with others, will chalenge him into the field, and ſpend bloud in the defence of it. Oh! how deare is ſuch an one, to a man who ſtands upon it? Even ſuch a man is hee who dare caſt himſelfe upon a promiſe: for hee equals God (in a ſort) in his ends: let God propound to himſelfe in what he will bee honoured; and faith inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concurres and faith, True Lord, it is meet, be famous in thy juſtice, ſatisfying it ſelf upon Chriſt: be honored in the wiſedome of thy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall purpoſe, and thy revealing it in time: receive glory from thy poore creature, for that gracious mercy of thine, that love, that power, and all that unſearchable riches of thine paſt our finding out: Oh! be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in all, at the hands of him who yet cannot reach it.<note place="margin">Rom. 11. ult. 1 Tim. 1.1.19</note> To the King immortall, inviſible, and only wiſe God, be all dominion and praiſe Faith then enlarging it ſelfe to all ſuch qualities as God ſeekes to bee great in, doth exceedingly honour him, and therefore is a grace ſo much the more to be ſought! All ſeeke the face of the Prince,<note place="margin">Prov. 26.29.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe greatneſſe delights in it. <hi>David</hi> having but a conceit of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> was implacable. Get this grace then, that ſo thou mayſt ſet up the Lord, and make him glorious in thine own heart,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 19.29</note> and in the hearts of all others, as neere as thou canſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let this move thee; When Chriſt ſhall come to judge, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>2</label> the iſſue of his enquiry will be, Whether faith or no faith?<note place="margin">Chriſts laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry will be for faith. 1 Cor. 3.13.14 Matth. 25.</note> I deny not, but he will alſo examine and try every mans worke by fire, and purge the good workes of his from all droſſe which cleaves to them. It is cleare by that in Matth. 25. that hee will take account of all the Talents that he hath lent out: But this ſhall bee the maine iſſue of all, how the maine Talent of the Goſpel hath been improved: that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it have been beleeved or no? It is plaine by Luk. 18.9. Thinke you (ſaith Chriſt) that when the Sonne of Man ſhall come to judge the world, he ſhall finde faith upon the earth? That then ſhall bee his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition. And no doubt, that ſhall be then in as great requeſt, as now it is in little. Then a world (if we had it) for a drop of this oyle; but the market is over. Well, let us then make it the great iſſue of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry (if we be wiſe) while it is called to day: If we lay one iſſue,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.15.</note> and God lay another, what a wofull loſſe of the day ſhall wee ſuſtaine? Who ſhall recompence our loſſe? God askes for faith, and we bring him in our many Sermons hearing, or prayers making, our duties do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Lord, Lord, have we not done great things in thy Name? Then ſhall he anſwer, Depart from me.<note place="margin">Matth. 7.22.</note> Will not this bee our hell ere wee come at it? But Faith will paſſe for currant in that day. Therefore uſe all diligence to make that ſure now: It will bee in vaine then to ſay: Alas! I was not aware of this iſſue; if I had, I would not have been to ſeeke.</p>
               <pb n="508" facs="tcp:45715:274"/>
               <p>Thirdly, God having found out who theſe are, will ſet them forth in that day, to bee wondred at before Men and Angels. This is that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>3</label> which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, 2 Theſſ. 1.10. when he ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints,<note place="margin">God will be admired in all and onely ſuch as beleeve.</note> and to be admired in all them that beleeve in that day; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our teſtimony was beleeved. What is it to be admired in all that beleeve? Surely then, God ſhall make fully knowne the infinite ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his mercy which he hath diſcovered, in ſaving his beleeving ones, when a world of others ſhall be rejected. How few behold God admirable in the converſion of any? Men have other objects of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration now to occupy their affections; as, who is the eminent rich man in the Countrey, who get the Kings favour, or bee the greateſt for their preferment: Theſe men doe admire. But as for that grace which hath choſen ſome to be beleevers, leaving thouſands of great note and parts, alas! it is ſlighted as a fancie, and control'd as a falſity: Nay, who are ſo ſcorn'd as ſuch? But in that day, thoſe great rich ones, and gallants, ſhall be deſpiſed; and then ſhall the Lord be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in beleevers. Here they lye by as wonderments. But there they ſhall reflect a glory upon God, who hath beſtowed ſuch favour upon them, as to give them faith. Oh! happy then thoſe who have kiſſed the Sonne, Pſal. 2. <hi>ult.</hi> It ſeemes that beleevers ſhall then bee Maſter-peeces, when as the Lord himſelfe ſhall bee glorious in them for his love to them. How ſhall they then bee glorious in the ſight of the world?<note place="margin">Numb. 10.17.</note> If <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were ſo glorified in the ſight of Iſrael, by reaſon of the government and Prieſthood which God put upon them, and that when as <hi>Kora</hi> and his fellowes had ſought to diſgrace them, how great ſhall the honour of beleevers be then, when it ſhall be ſome addition to Gods own glory, that he hath made them ſuch? Can God be admired in the choyce gifts of <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 36.1.</note> but they muſt needs be glorious who enjoy them? Oh! then it will be the chiefeſt honour to be a beleever, then ſhall it not repent them of any pains they have taken, that they have ſet to their ſeale that God is true: Then ſhall they ſhine as the ſtarres who have converted others,<note place="margin">Dan. 12.3.</note> and have beene converted themſelves: Then ſhall it appeare who are Gods off-ſpring borne of God,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.</note> having his ſeed in them, Kings and Prieſts to God, His Jewels, his peculiar ones, and Favourites. Doe yee not ſee how a Prince is admired, who weares a Jewell of peerleſſe price upon his hat, or in his ring? Shall a Jewell grace a man, and ſhall not they bee glorious from whom God receives a kinde of grace? Tell me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were better for us to be theſe perſons, or (with the multitude of wicked ones) to be dazled with their beauty in that day, and to gnaw and bite their tongues for very anguiſh, that they had not the grace to beleeve the word in ſeaſon?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4. Motive. God ſhall come in ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance againſt unbeleevers.</note>Fourthly, then ſhall the Lord come in treble vengeance againſt all that know not God, nor obeyed his Goſpel: who put away the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from them in a ſcorne, and made a mocke at his threats, who ſaid to God, Depart from us. Where is now that tongue of yours, which ſaid, 2 Pet. 3. Where is the promiſe of his comming? Come, let us ſee this day of the Lord. It ſhall be a blacke day to you, and you ſhall wiſh it as farre off then, as neere before. For then ſhall the Lord ſet the
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:45715:274"/> true colours upon every ſinne, and the moſt terrible upon this. No Thiefe, no Harlot ſhall looke ſo griſely, ſo gaſtly as an unbeliever. Hell ſhall be heat thrice hotter then <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> furnace for all ſuch: There the Sonne of God walked; but here they ſuffer,<note place="margin">Amos 5.18.</note> who have trod under foot the blood of the Covenant, and counted it an unholy thing, and unworthy of them. The Goſpell is hid to none,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.29.</note> but ſuch as periſh. This is that condemnation Joh. 3.19. They are condemned already, and the wrath of God abides upon them in right, but there it ſhall ceaſe, and take full poſſeſſion. They have deſpiſed the remedy, and caſt the potion of their recovery againſt the walles. They ſhall not reſiſt the quaſhing force of this rocke falling upon them,<note place="margin">Luke 20.17.</note> and grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to powder. This ſinne oppoſes God in all that, in which he ſought honour to himſelfe: and therefore how terrible will hee bee in revenging himſelfe? How fearfull will it bee to ſee men condemned even by him who yet is the Judge of Gods Chancery? God hath no quarrell with men, like to the quarrell of his Covenant, Levit. 26.25. When they goe contrary to God in this kinde, hee will goe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to them, and avenge them: when hee avoucheth them to bee his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ones in the blood of the Covenant,<note place="margin">Deut 26.17.</note> and himſelfe to bee their God all-ſufficient, and that freely, being enemies and traytors; and they ſhall diſavow him, and tell him to his face, that he is a lyar,<note place="margin">1 John 5 10.</note> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nothing leſſe, and his Miniſters to beare falſe witneſſe of him: when he bids them lay down their weapons and come in,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.15.</note> and hee will pardon their rebellions: yet they wilfully perſiſt in bearing Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, what poſſible way can there be of reconciliation? When tender mercies are rejected, what is to looked for, but jealouſie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to hell? Shall a ſecond blood of God bee ſhed for ſuch as have deſpiſed the former? If they who deſpiſe <hi>Moſes</hi> Law,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.2.3.</note> are put to death under two or three witneſſes, how ſhall they eſcape who deſpiſe ſo great ſalvation?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that is to bee highly eſteemed and enſued,<note place="margin">5. Motive. Faith is a rare Jewell. 2 Theſſ. 3.2.</note> which is ſo rare a commodity, and to be found in ſo few hands, a flower that growes in ſo few Gardens. But Faith is ſuch an one, 2 Theſſ. 3.2. Faith is not of all: nay, the portion of very few. Every one ſeekes to ingroſſe rich wares, that they may raiſe the market at their pleaſures, for their owne gaine. But the Royall Merchant of this Pearle, beyond price, may well goe alone: for there bee few who will goe to the price of his Pearle. Oh! if the paucity of Beleevers, or rarity of Faith, or ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe either of ſuch as preach it, or hearken after it, might perſwade, this reaſon might ſtrongly (as a Load-ſtone) draw us to beleeve. Such as remaine not prophane, yet reſt themſelves in a forme of godlineſſe, keep under the line, and ſubſiſt in a dangerous degree to faith-ward, but dare not reſigne up themſelves to the promiſe. When it ſhould come to this point, they make ſure of ſome faire retreat or other for themſelves: And when this fruit ſhould come to the birth, there is no ſtrength to bring forth; and ſo they faile of the grace of God, and dye in that ſtate. All that is in requeſt with men, is, how they may get to heaven with moſt eaſe,<note place="margin">Eſay 37.3.</note> and rid their hands of this trouble of ſelfe-deniall, and ſelfe-reſigning to God: They will not put themſelves out
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:45715:275"/> of their owne power, nor clearly diſcharge themſelves of all weights which hang on and preſſe downe in this kinde, and therefore juſtly may that be mens ruine, which they preferre before mercy, that is, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, pleaſure, ſloth, and eaſe. Let us then be of thoſe few that beleeve, and not of the world of unbeleevers.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">6. Motive. No riddance of our diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers till we beleeve.</note>Laſtly, let this prevaile, that untill thou beleeveſt, and drowneſt thy diſtempers in the promiſe, thou ſhalt never be rid of them: Thy ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerings, feares and diſquietneſſe of thoughts, thine hard heart, thine impatience, thy old corruptions; yea, Satan with ſeven worſe ſpirits, will returne, and enthrall thee more deſperately then ever before. Thou canſt have no ſecurity from them otherwiſe, but a truce onely, which will end in worſe warre. All thy hearings, prayers, hopes, duties will be forfeit and periſh.<note place="margin">Matth. 12.</note> And were not this lamentable? Eſpecially for ſuch as have been ſo faire for faith, ſwet for it (as 2 Joh. 8.) to loſe their reward, for adding a little more ſoundneſſe of heart, to their former knowledge and affections? Is it not a ſad ſight to ſee one to make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack in the haven? Who would not pitty himſelfe for ſuch folly? Who would lay egges in the ſand to bee troden by beaſts,<note place="margin">Job. 39.14.</note> except a foole bereft of underſtanding? Satan will not give thee over, but ſift thee throughly: If there be no faith in thee, there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thee and others. Conſider (good friends) what the Scripture ſpeakes, If yee will not beleeve, you ſhall not be eſtabliſhed, Eſay 7.9. Nothing but this Anchor will ſettle the ſhip; nothing but Faith will overcome the world, either within us, or without us. The heart being unpurified, will bewray it ſelfe: onely to faith is granted to weare the crowne of victory,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.5.</note> for this is that victory, even our faith. Oh! who would be alway unſetled, and lye open to all miſchiefe, who might prevent it?<note place="margin">Zach. 12.10. Concluſion of the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> But I conclude this Uſe, with the former Directions and Motives. Pray to God (for the Spirit of grace and ſupplication goe together) that his ſpirit may perſwade thy ſoule to both theſe, to deny thy ſelfe, and to reſigne up thy ſelfe to the promiſe? Say thus, Lord, thy workes are all perfect, where thou beginſt thou finiſheſt. It is beyond fleſh to retaine this grace: I have run, I have laboured; but except thou give me the hand to helpe me over this ſteep hill, I ſhall fall back again to my old diſtempers, &amp; the end will be worſe then the beginning.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 14.13.</note> Oh therefore let me goe up the hill of faith, as <hi>Ionathan</hi> did up the hill againſt the Philiſtines; give mee a ſigne as thou gaveſt him, and then all lets and oppoſitions ſhall fall before me: all high things which ſet up themſelves; yea, the worſt, that is, the contrariety of heart to this thy way of beleeving, ſhall be caſt downe: and then ſhall I ſubmit nakedly to this obedience of faith. The Lord grant it to us all for his Names ſake. This for the firſt and maine Uſe of Exhortation be ſpoken.</p>

It is as great a grace to preſerve the ſoule, as it was to beget it at firſt: enemies will not give us over as ſoone as wee are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to God, but rather aſſault us more forcibly, as Chriſt himſelfe was by Satan, after his baptiſme and unction to be Mediator. Now then, what helpe have we againſt all affronts, ſave to caſt our ſoules up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for reliefe and redreſſe, whom wee have already adventured upon for pardon and life? What is our Charter ſave that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, Be of good courage, I have overcome the world:<note place="margin">Joh. 16.33. &amp; 14.1. Eſay 26.3.</note> Let not your hearts be troubled, you beleeve in the Father, beleeve alſo in me? Caſt your ſelves upon Jehova, for he is eternall ſtrength. Here on the one ſide ſteps in feare, and ſaith, I ſhall never overcome ſuch a corruption, and luſt, of earthlineſſe, or pride, or ſelfe-love, or revenge, or unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe: or, I ſhall not grow in grace as others doe, but alway ſtand at a ſtay: or, I feele no thriving by the meanes, ſtill after faſting, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the old deadneſſe of heart abides, and I walke (as the horſe in the mill) in one dead frame of heart and life. Well, deny thy ſelfe firſt, and then reſigne up thy ſelfe unto the promiſe. Doeſt thou wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly yeeld thy ſelfe to any baſe corruption? Or doeſt thou wilfully ſlight the meanes, or defile thy conſcience? Then looke to thy ſelfe, and lin not, till thy pardon and peace be renewed. But otherwiſe look not at thy diſtruſt or unworthineſſe, but humble thy ſoule for thine unbeliefe, and recover by the promiſe: Say thus, Lord, when I was weake, and without ſtrength, I caſt my ſelfe upon thy word for pardon of ſin, and releaſe of curſe: how much more may I doe it for ſupply of wants? Plead the promiſe now as thou wert wont to cleave to it at firſt.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Bathſheba</hi> was afraid her ſonne <hi>Salomon</hi> ſhould bee defeated of the Kingdome,<note place="margin">1 King. 1.15.22.26.</note> ſhe and <hi>Nathan</hi> plotted together to concurre with one Argument, and came to <hi>David,</hi> ſaying: Did not my Lord the King ſay, that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſhould reigne? How then is it, that <hi>Adonija</hi> ſits on the throne? What did David? He rouzes up his dying body, and ſweares, As the Lord lives, looke what I have ſaid, ſhall be according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done. Thus by pleading they ſped: Plead thou the promiſe which once God gave thee, and ſo ſhalt thou alſo: Lord, Didſt not thou ſay, Sinne ſhall not reigne? Thine ſhall grow? Thou wilt finiſh thy worke, and they ſhall hold out to the end? And now, lo the Divel perſwades me it ſhall be otherwiſe? But, O Lord, had I firſt clave to ſenſe and feeling, I had never beleeved: Therefore now teach mee to caſt my ſelfe upon thy Word ſtill, and looke off from appearances. Although I feele no great growth, yet becauſe thou haſt ſaid I ſhall, and I doe not wilfully oppoſe it, therefore I beleeve I doe. In like manner ſteps in the malice of Satans inſtruments, and they threaten my ruine, and make me thinke I ſhall one day periſh by them. But I aske my ſoule, Doeſt thou not ſide and ſort with them by an ill conſcience, forſaking thine integrity? Then caſt thy ſelfe upon the promiſe, Pſal. 73. end. Call thy ſelfe a foole, a beaſt, for diſtruſting God: Roll thy wayes
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:45715:276"/> upon him, and ſay, Was not I alwayes with thee? Didſt thou not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to guide me by counſell, till glory? whom have I in heaven or earth like thee? When <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> in 2 Chron. 20.5. was beſet with three armies, what did he? Cleave to ſenſe, and ſo deſpaire? No, he pleads a promiſe, an old one, made to <hi>Salomon</hi> at the dedication of the Temple, Didſt thou not ſay, when enemies ſhould beſiege us, and we looke up to thy throne, thou wouldſt looke downe? Lo, here is an object for thee, Mount Seir, and Moab, and others. What did God? Inſtantly anſwered, and ſcattered them all. Alas (brethren) our faith forgets her plea, and is weary of her worke. God ſets ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies about our eares to file off the ruſt of faith that ſhee may ſtill ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him againſt feares, and carnall reaſon: We ſay we have caſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor upon Gods bottome for pardon, but how ſhall it appeare? If we ſay ſo, who ſhall gainſay us in a ſecret thing? But ſhew it then in our courſe that ſecret grace may diſcover it ſelfe in ſtraits and trialls, that we may know all that is in our owne hearts, either how weake they are that we may ſtrengthen them, or how ſtrong, that we may be thankfull.</p>
               <p>But when ſorrowes and feares beſet thee on every ſide, ſickneſſe, debt, loſſes of husband, wife, good miniſtery, when bad times, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of debauchedneſſe, malitious foes, treacherous friends; when all theſe or any would make us thinke our faith was but a fancy, and we caſt our ſelves upon a promiſe in vaine: Then looke about thee, here, and never till now is the triall whether thou haſt caſt thy ſelfe upon God or no; upon his wiſdome to reach thee a way of eſcape, upon his power, his truth, love and conſtancy, that he can and will free thee: Is this faith to pretend caſting thy ſelfe upon God, once for all, and when trialls come,<note place="margin">Joh. 11.27.39.</note> to warpe, and to ſay with <hi>Martha,</hi> Now hee ſtincketh? To fling up and downe and ſay, How ſhall I beare this loſſe? Endure ſuch affront? Get out of this poverty? Avoid this enemy? Ceaſe all other tricks, and learne one better then all: As the Cat once being challenged by the Fox in point of wit, when the Dogs came upon them, the Fox with all his wit, was torne in peeces, the Cat had but one way but it was worth all, ſhe got up an high tree and ſecured herſelfe. Read Ezra 8.22. He would not diſhonour God, but fell to the worke of faſting and beleeving, and ſo prevailed. Give not thy right in one promiſe for a world: Its a fountaine better then all dry pits: A wiſe man will not ſell his poſſibility of a great inheritance for a trifle: aſſure thy ſelf, there is a promiſe in the word belonging to every duty, and every part of a Chriſtians courſe, which who ſo can be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leeve, ſhall go through it, whether doing or ſuffering, with ſweet eaſe, in reſpect of him who goeth to work of his owne head. He that caſts himſelfe upon the word, cuts off many troubles which others meet with; becauſe his heart being well appaid in Gods love, is not eaſily unſettled; and as for ſuch as muſt pinch, yet there hee is upheld, knowing they come from God in love, are no greater then mercy ſees meet, are ſuch as Chriſt himſelfe is a party in, and affords to his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, his owne courage, meekneſſe, power, and victory to ſuſtaine them in, and in his due time will give a redemption from to all who
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:45715:276"/> wait for it in well doing, and faint not. Plead therefore the promiſe, and truſt God in all.</p>
               <p>The third Branch of Exhortation concernes thoſe who have caſt <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>3</label> themſelves upon the promiſe, both for pardon,<note place="margin">Perſevering in beleeving pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> &amp; alſo for all other ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port here: To ſuch I ſay, give not God over here neither, but ſtill preſſe him for aſſurance, &amp; fulneſſe of perſwaſion touching both. The faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full improvement of the promiſe in reſpect of the truth of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, is often requited by the Lord with ſuch a gratious ſtrength and full faile of the Spirit of the promiſe, as makes God and the ſoule to grow into cloſe communion, and holy familiarity, and carries the ſoule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove her doubts, feares and complaints; becauſe the Spirit of God witneſſeth unto our ſpirits, both that we are his, and hee ours: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall ſeparate us from his love, nor it from us: All things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to life and godlineſſe, ſhall be miniſtred. This is that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of, Epheſ. 1.13. By which Spirit after you had belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, you were ſealed; and by it the Lord makes the ſoule ſo intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in him, that as he knowes who are his, 1 Tim. 3.1. So they who are his, know themſelves ſo, reflecting this aſſurance to their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, ſo that they walke as enlarged ones, becauſe perfect love ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells feare. I will not ſay, that their joy doth alway equall their peace: But their peace equalls their aſſurance. Hence it is, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſuch finde hard duties eaſie, croſſes welcome, feares vaniſht,<note place="margin">Leſſer light in Faith may goe with greater aſſurance.</note> God preſent in ordinary, ſo that their falls are few, and their peace is conſtant according to that knowledge which they have. Which I adde, becauſe I doubt not but many an upright Chriſtian may in ſome caſes exceed him in ſome acts of cloſeneſſe and obedience, both in doing and ſuffering, who yet goes beyond him in aſſurance; the reaſon is plaine, becauſe aſſurance followeth not alway upon the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of light, but the conſtant living by faith in that light which a man hath; ſo that for lacke of light greater faith may come ſhort of that meaſure of obedience which leſſer faith may have. To returne, let none be wanting to himſelfe in ſeeking the greateſt degree, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of reſting upon this, that his faith is unfeigned, and the faith of the Elect, and ſo never ſeeke further. This is the generall diſeaſe of moſt Chriſtians at this day, wherein I am perſwaded few attaine that degree which formerly in times of ſmaller light (but more tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, conſcience, watchfulneſſe and ſincerity, with diligence) they attained unto: Oh, thou ſhalt one day finde the fruit hereof,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> when that broad doore of entrance into the Kingdome ſhall not be granted thee! If any aske by what markes the Spirit of ſealing is diſcerned: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: Firſt, by more then ordinary ſelfe-deniall, humility, <note place="margin">Markes of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance. Luke 5.8.</note>ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: The nearer the ſoule comes to God, the more it abhorres it ſelfe. Secondly, ſuch an one hath much inured herſelfe to weigh the promiſe; as that ſcholler ſooneſt growes to bee above his rules, who hath got moſt exactneſſe in his rules. Thirdly, he is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily free from doubts. Rom. 8. ult. I am perſwaded that neither life, nor death, &amp;c. Fourthly, death is welcome to him, as it was to <hi>Simeon,</hi> Lord let thy ſervant depart in peace, becauſe mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation. Fifthly, ſuch an one is above carnall reſpects
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:45715:277"/> or owne ends, for he knowes his requitall is not daunted with trouble, hard duties, loſſes for Gods cauſe, for hee underſtands his hundred fold. And ſo I might adde more, which the examples of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> in Scripture will affoord. One more I adde, If God viſit them with any ſpirituall deſertion (as he may in extraordinary) yet the experience of former mercy, at the loweſt point, keepes them ſo, that the grace of God ſhall ever be ſufficient, and therefore they ſhall bee content for the time of their eclipſe, to be under infirmity, ſeeing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God is moſt glorified,<note place="margin">Luke 22.42.</note> and their grace approved. Thus it was with our head Chriſt himſelfe, and with <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. So much for this third and laſt Branch, and ſo for the whole uſe of exhortation.</p>

Say thine owne heart oft miſgives thee, ſaying, I have long heard, and received the Sacraments, with other helps, but I cannot put on the Lord Jeſus, I cannot in particular faſten upon each part of his Mediation and Merit, as King, Prieſt and Prophet: I am afraid to die: I doubt, if hard times ſhould come, I ſhould bee the firſt ſhould ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and deny Chriſt: I am troubled oft about my evidences: when I have any, I keep them not long, mine example is darke, my peace ſmall, my ſelfe very ſilly to conceive, remember, affect goodneſſe, all goe before me; and a thouſand ſuch. Well: But yet this thou haſt, that when all is done,<note place="margin">Joh. 19.7.</note> yet thou art not willing to give over the Lord: there is a ſecret thing which upholds thee, thou knoweſt not as yet what God is doing for thee; but thou ſhalt know: Thou ſayeſt, <hi>Whither ſhould I go Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 6.68.</note> 
                  <hi>if I forſake thee? Thou haſt the words of eternal life.</hi> This againe thou haſt, when thou canſt not ſwim, yet thou lieſt upon the bladders of the promiſe, waiting for more skill. If thou ſink as thou art comming, yet thou haſt an hand to put out, and a tongue to ſay, Lord Jeſus catch me.<note place="margin">Matth. 14.30.</note> Thou canſt not anſwer every doubt by a word, but thou plungeſt thyſelfe upon it, to anſwer for thee, and canſt ſend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, World, and Unbelief, to Chriſt in thy ſtead. Be comforted, all is well. When <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 12. was bidden to put on his Cloke and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, and follow the Angell, though he ſaw not why, or wherefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſleep, yet this he did, he obeyed, and did as hee was bidden; and when hee was paſt all Barres and Gates, hee ſaw the truth of all. So doſt thou obey, although yet thou ſeeſt not why. But in time thou ſhalt. And therefore doe not mutter, ſeaſons of more light, ſtrength and comfort, are in the Lords diſpoſe, not thine. If thou be neither la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie nor rebellious, it is God, and not thou, who holds thee at this ſtay. Be as God will have thee: Behold the ſalvation of God, it ſhall bee thy ſtrength to ſit ſtill. Perhaps there is more within then appeares as yet. Rather wonder that thou haſt any thing, that thou liveſt, or mayſt look up to heaven, then thy ſtrength is no greater. And this know, the Lord tries thee with little, to ſee if that will make thee thankful, that he may give thee more. Still claſp upon the Promiſe; remember <hi>Salomons</hi> ſpeech,<note place="margin">Prov. 30.26.</note> The Cony is a weake Nation; but they make their holes in

The Ivy is a weake plant, but it hath teeth and ſtrings to faſten hard upon a bricke wall, and ſo growes above the Oake. A weake child hath all the parts of a ſtrong man, although not the ſtrength of any. In a word, apply that to thy ſelfe which the Lord ſpeakes Eſay 50.10. He that hath no light, but is in darkeneſſe, yet feares God, and obeyes his voice; let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay himſelfe upon his God. Better a little light then thy owne ſparkles. As for the worlds diſdaine it is common to thee and the ſtrongeſt.

Before we have heard how croſſely he carried himſelfe toward this meſſage, and the Holy Ghoſt hath at large ſhamed him for it: But now the Lord having got the victory over his ſtout and rebellious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, lo, how he alſo rejoyceth to deſcribe it, and to preſent unto us what a ſtrange change is wrought in him. For why? Now he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits himſelfe to the rule of the word, at which he had ſo cavilled, and to the uttermoſt thereof, he went downe and obeyed, according to all the circumſtances of the word of the Prophet.<note place="margin">In two things.</note> Two things there were in the Prophets ſaying: Firſt, a ſolemne charge in and under the authority of God, this charge he yeeldeth unto:<note place="margin">1.

Secondly, there was a promiſe,<note place="margin">2. Extent of the promiſe.</note> and that was a perſwaſion to obey from the aſſured ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that would come thereof. This promiſe he conſents unto, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges it, &amp; good reaſon to be in it, and takes it as no humane, but a meere divine cure, and ſo concurres (as I have ſaid) with it, and that to the uttermoſt intention and meaning of it. From theſe two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ariſe two points, the firſt whereof we will now propound, open and make uſe of ere we come to the other. The former point then is this, Gods commands are ſad things, not to be ſhuffled, or diſpenced with, but to be obeyed, according to the true tenor, intent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents thereof. Perhaps ſome may thinke,<note place="margin">The groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the former of theſe.</note> that I am more curious then I need to be in faſtning a point of ſuch weight upon words (in ſhew) not bearing it well up: For why?

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> fully of the Doctrine: and firſt I will grant that perhaps in the Scripture many Texts may be found, in which the ſadneſſe and cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of obeying commands might be more ſtrongly grounded; but
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:45715:278"/> that is not the queſtion now; onely this it is whether the expreſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Holy Ghoſt touching the punctualneſſe of his obedience be not ground ſufficient of the Doctrine; eſpecially the Text ſeeming to mention it with delight, and to record how farre the Lord brought downe <hi>Naamans</hi> heart from the extremity of ſlighting all, to ſuch an extent of obeying to the uttermoſt.</p>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>2</label> Secondly, I would have it well noted, That meerly occaſionall and temporary commands (when the Lord thinkes good to give them in charge) binde as ſadly and fully,<note place="margin">Occaſionall commands binde as much as morall and perpetuall, for the preſent.</note> for the preſent, and for them whom they concern, as any morall and perpetuall ones doe: I adde, that they are as dangerous and ſad in the tranſgreſſion to ſuch, as they are made unto, whether the parties be faithfull or unfaithfull. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: It was but a meere poſitive, and (as farre as I can learne) a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary charge, Exod. 12.22. to ſprinkle the Doore-poſts of the Iſraelites houſes with the blood of the Lamb which was to be the Paſſeover (I confeſſe the Sacrament was for continuance, but the ſprinkling was but for the preſent) Howbeit, had the charge beene broken, how ſad the effect had been,<note place="margin">Numb. 20.8.</note> all know. <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſtriking the Rocke, was the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience onely to an occaſionall command, in reſpect of the act done at that time; but the neglect of the due manner of doing of it (though through infirmity onely) coſt him the loſſe of that type of entring into Gods Reſt, that is the promiſed Land. And leſt any (perhaps) might except againſt this inſtance, take others of meere occaſionall nature: That of the young Prophet charg'd to goe and denounce againſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,<note place="margin">2 Kings 13.3.4.</note> and not to eate or drinke in the place, was a thing in it ſelfe neither good nor bad: yet God having poſitively ſet it downe for a rule to curb him, we ſee the tranſgreſſion of it coſt him his life, whatſoever colour hee might pretend from the old Prophets reaſons or perſon to induce him to it. So might I ſay of all other. It was but an occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall thing that the Lord charged <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. to ſtay for <hi>Samuel,</hi> and not to adventure to pray, and offer ſacrifice himſelfe, before the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.2.3.</note> It was but occaſionall that he was charged to deſtroy all <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek,</hi> branch and ruſh, man and beaſt: yet, what his diſpenſing and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring with God in both, coſt him, wee all know. Briefly, I ſay of all ſuch incident and occaſioned commands, whether for the temporari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them, or for the indifferency of the things urged: they are as ſad things for the neceſſity, and penalties, for doing or for not doing, as the morall. Ceremonies in their nature had nothing in them to force obedience;<note place="margin">Numb. 15.32.</note> howbeit, hee that tranſgreſſed one of them, as in gathering of ſticks upon the Sabbath, offering a beaſt with any blemiſh in it, ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Ark contrary to the charge,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6.7.</note> or the like, wee ſee had fearfull puniſhments annexed, as to be ſtoned, to be ſtricken dead, to be cut off from his people. And why? Becauſe (during Gods pleaſure) they were in as great force, and bound the conſcience as much as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, whereof they were but as ſhels, and whereto they onely ſerved as fences and fortifications. So that ſtill the Doctrine holds firme, That Gods commands are ſad things,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are ſad things.</note> not to be diſpenſed with at our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or by our diſtinctions: But indiſpenſable, unappealable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable: and therefore to be obeyed according to the intent, and the
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:45715:278"/> extent, length and breadth thereof. For the proſecution of which point, firſt, I will prove it by Scripture, ſecondly, I will reaſon it, thirdly, ſhew both what the intent of a command is,<note place="margin">Proofes of it.</note> and what the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is, and ſo come to Uſe.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> For Reaſons of this point, they are many. Firſt, the manner wherein the commands were given by God, argued of what nature they were:<note place="margin">Their firſt making was ſolemne.</note> all that terror and awfulneſſe which he caſt upon the camp, arraigning ſix hundred thouſand men, beſides women &amp; children, at his tribunall, and not admitting them to come within the liſts ſet at the foote of the mount, beſides thoſe fearefull earthquakes, thunders, lightnings, darkeneſſe and ſmoke which ſcared the beholders, and made <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe to quake, and rottenneſſe to enter into the bones of men, ſhewed ſufficiently that Gods commands were no noſe of wax to be turned which way we liſt, nor trifles to be dallied with, but ſtedfaſt, weighty and ſolemne things, to be obſerved with ſad and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious care of heart, with great cloſeneſſe and narrowneſſe: And ſurely if the Lord Jeſus in his commands, was ſo full of authority when hee was at ſuch diſtance, and ſo farre off; how much more authority is he of in thoſe commands of his publiſhed in the Goſpell, I meane the command of Faith, and thoſe morall commands of the Law which himſelfe hath diſtinctly eſtabliſhed, and interpreted, (as we ſee it was his ſcope in thoſe Sermons upon the Mount) preſſing that he came not to breake,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.17.</note> but to ſtrengthen them?

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> Secondly, the commands of God borrow their weight from his owne nature whence they proceed. The will of God is the Idea of them,<note place="margin">They borrow their ſadneſſe from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Commander.</note> and they doe but argue and witneſſe what that is. Now we know the will of God is moſt ſoveraigne, powerfull, indiſpencible, whether we ſpeake of it as his nature and being, or as the effect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in that tranſcendent and ſecret way and purpoſe thereof, whereby he hath determined of the ends &amp; ſtates of all men: Now then are not thoſe expreſſions of his will in his commands, anſwerable thereto?

Yes ſurely, Men will bow to the chaire of Eſtate when the King is out of it for neare reſemblance: How much more ſhall we fall under the authority of commands, wherein the Lord is ſo preſent, as that he can never be ſeparated? And whereunto he hath annexed ſuch ſad penalties as no mortall creature can either avoid, or undergoe? So much for the ſecond.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> Thirdly, this appeares by due proportion. It is for the honour and
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:45715:279"/> Majeſty of God, to tye the conſcience and inner man of his creature, with as ſtrong ties, and to as narrow obedience, as any mortall Prince can tye the outward man to cloſeneſſe and punctualneſſe of duty.<note place="margin">The propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lawes of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Princes, doth prove it.</note> But we ſee Princes count it their chiefe honour to plant themſelves in their ſubjects hearts, in the uttermoſt and deepeſt awe of ſoveraigntie. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be never ſo diſtant from their ſubjects, yet they look that the influence of their Royall pleaſure ſhall goe through their whole Kingdome: That none ſhould be ſo daring and preſumptuous, as once to mute or quetch, if they once proclaime their will. That muſt ſtand for a Law: if any man enquire or diſpute their prerogative, they eſteeme them Traytors, ſo ſacred and inviolable they looke, that their Perſons and Edicts ſhould be, that they will have them indiſputable and unimpeached. See it in <hi>Saul:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 14.24.</note> when it pleaſed him to enact a Law for the time of battell, that no man ſhould touch a bit, or taſte a drop of meat or drinke, till the Philiſtines were overthrowne; how did that Proclamation of his force the wils of his ſubjects to obey when as yet they were ſtrongly provoked to break it? Could an Edict of ſuch ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor (ſcarce juſt) ſo prevaile, and that in ſecret, and ſhall not the Lords moſt righteous will much more? Is it for the Kings honour to preſſe the ſubject, not onely for civill homage, but for conſcience ſake to obey him; and is it not much more for the glory of our King invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and immortall? Yes ſure, it makes much for his renowne, that all his people doe, without all queſtioning and difficulty, freely and nakedly cloſe with his commands, for that ſoveraignty and authority ſake, which himſelfe hath conveyed into them: Elſe we ſhould make the Lord a weake King.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, wee muſt know, that the Lord hath marvellous rewards <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>4</label> for obeyers of his commands,<note place="margin">God hath great rewards for obeyers. Pſal. 19.10.11. 1 Sam. 22.7.</note> and therefore well may hee require at our hands, excellent obedience: his pay is not common, ordinary, ſlight and generall, but cloſe and bountifull. In obeying his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, there is great reward. <hi>Saul</hi> lookt that his ſervants ſhould bee very cloſe and faithfull to him (in a ſinfull caſe) becauſe of his rewards. Can the ſonne of <hi>Iſhai</hi> give you Olives and Vineyards? If a Maſter allow a ſpeciall ſervant double wages, he looks that his ſervice ſhould bee very cloſe, and his eye in every corner for his Maſters advantage. So here: None give ſuch wages as he, therefore no worke ſhould be done like his, no commands ought to be ſo punctuall as his. If a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhould make his ſervant his childe, and give him his lands, he gives him no more then he may loſe; nay, then he muſt forgoe. Princes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſome ſubjects rewards reaching to the halfe of their Kingdome. But the Lord makes every ſervant of his, a free borne childe, and gives him a never fading inheritance of glory; yea, a whole, an eternall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for the leaſt obedience they performe, even for a Cup of cold water; yea, for every command they obey.<note place="margin">Matth. 10.42.</note> And ſhall not they then bee punctuall, cloſe and ſerious in their obeying?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, whatſoever is in God, is eminently ſo: not onely in reſpect <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>5</label> of influence and cauſing, but of perfection and integrity.<note place="margin">Whatſoever is in God, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent. Pſal. 19.</note> Now Gods will is himſelfe, and his Commands (as I have ſaid) are the ingraven forme thereof. Therefore they muſt bee eminently ſuch as they are.
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:45715:280"/> Are they righteous, cloſe, ſound, pure? Then muſt they alſo bee emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſo, exceeding pure, righteous, ſoveraigne and ſolemne. Nothing in God is common or vulgar: therefore nothing of God, or comming from ſuch eminency,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.</note> can be otherwiſe. And, if the commands of God (which are as the Seale) are ſuch, then ought the ſtamp in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſpirit and practice of men, be ſuch, which ought to be as the wax to the ſeale.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>6</label> Sixthly, if the Lord had not Law and Soveraignty ſufficient in his owne hands to rule his ſubjects and creatures,<note place="margin">Elſe God his ſubjects might rule him, not he them.</note> then might they give him law, not he them. What a poore and titular King were hee, who muſt ſtand to the good will of his people, as being more ſtrong and ſubſiſting in themſelves, then himſelfe? What a King would he be, who either for lacke of power, or becauſe hee hath reſigned up his power, cannot match them who are under his command? How poore was it with <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 3.39.</note> when his owne ſonne and his ſubjects; yea, <hi>Ioab</hi> and <hi>Abiſhai</hi> were too ſtrong for him? A true King muſt bee furniſht with power, policie, and influence of authority ſufficient, to curb, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match, and ſubdue his ſubjects: how much more then the Lord? Doubtleſſe, were not his lawes full of majeſty and authority, they could not match and equall the corruption of their hearts, whom they ought to governe. For example: The heart of man is very ſtout, lofty and rebellious: If then the Word and Law of God were not full of ſtrength, able to make it quake and tremble; yea, to caſt downe and breake the rockes and hills,<note place="margin">Nahum. 1.3.</note> and to make Carmell and Lebanon to ſhake,<note place="margin">Dan. 5.6.</note> how ſhould he controll it? Even <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> knees ſmote toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at his hand-writing. The heart of man is baſe and ſlaviſh; Slaves watch their ſeaſon and opportunity, when their Maſters eyes is off, &amp; his backe turned, to play their parts. If then this law of his were not (like the ſoule in the body) wholly in all, and wholly in every part, beholding the creature alway, in each corner, and at every turne, how would hypocrites make bold with him? But now his whip is before them, and his ſword hangs over them perpetually: His Sergeant and Keeper is never from their heeles: their owne conſcience and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (as <hi>Eliſha's</hi> with <hi>Gehazi</hi>) going out with them, &amp; comming in; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall they goe from his preſence, but hee will over-take them? If they goe up to Heaven,<note place="margin">Pſal. 139.8.</note> or downe to Hell, or to the utmoſt parts of the Earth, his eye followes them, and they are ſtill naked before him. Therefore there is no playing their rex more in one place, or one time, then another.<note place="margin">Jer. 17.9.</note> So againe, The heart of man is deep and deceitfull, who can know it? If then the Lord were not more ſearching, narrow and politick, then all the cunning of hypocrites, and if his commands were not able to hunt them out of all their nooks and corners (as <hi>Samuel</hi> did <hi>Saul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 1 King. 14.</note> and as <hi>Abija</hi> did <hi>Ieroboams</hi> wife) how ſhould he keep his ſtate and dignity over it? Muſt he not needs be over-reached by it? But now the candle of the Lord ſearcheth all the bowels of the belly:<note place="margin">Prov. 20.27.</note> all thoſe ſecret windings and turnings of a cloſe and falſe heart, are open to him, and to his word, commands and terrors (even as <hi>Benhadads</hi> plots to <hi>Eliſha.</hi>) And ſo may I ſay of all the reſt.<note place="margin">2 King. 6.12.</note> The word of God is fully able to match and controll whatſoever is in the corrupt heart of
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:45715:280"/> man, and in that reſpect is a law meet and fit torule and controll it. And therefore how meeke, calme, how open, plaine, how loyall, faithfull ſhould that obedience be, which the ſoule ſhould performe unto his commands! So much for this.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, the Lord hath power to repeal Lawes, as well as to make <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>7</label> them: his will maketh that to be Law at one time,<note place="margin">God hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to repeate the ſaddeſt law, therefore to make it. Deut. 22.6.</note> which at another is none: he can reconcile contraries by his will: he that at one time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids to kill the Damme upon the Egges, at another time commands to kill the women and their ſucklings at their breaſts, or in travell, or big with childe, and yet both lawfull: He that forbids the ſpoiling of ſo much as the ſcraps that fall from our Tables, or are left after meales, at another, commands the remainder of the Paſſeover next morning,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.3.</note> to be burnt with fire:<note place="margin">Exod. 12.36.</note> He that forbids to ſteale a pin or a point from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, commands to rob men of their beſt jewels, gold and ſilver. So that from his mouth we muſt receive Law: his will is Law, either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding or enjoyning. Therefore it muſt needs be, that it is ſoveraigne and not to be controlled by any, or all the creatures. The Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands policie to be uſed by a Captaine in warre; yet if hee will have men play the fooles, and fight with Lampes and Rammes-hornes,<note place="margin">Judg. 20.29. Joſh. 6.8.</note> it is better then policie: yea, he will have <hi>Saul</hi> to wait for <hi>Samuel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 13.13.</note> although his Souldiers goe from him, and his enemies are ready to ſurprize him. When the Lord commands, it is a ſinne to ſuffer an Oxe to periſh, or a ſheep to miſcarry in a ditch, or the like: And againe,<note place="margin">Luke 14.5. 1 Sam. 15.3.</note> when he pleaſeth all the fat Oxen and Cattell of a Kingdome muſt bee ſlaine downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rights, and be made dung for the earth: yea, their owners alſo muſt be deſtroyed. So much for reaſons.</p>
               <p>Now I come to the ſecond generall; viz. to anſwer thoſe two que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>1</label> What I mean by the Intenſion and Extenſion of Commands. By Intenſion I underſtand the ſimplicity, uprightneſſe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Intenſion &amp; Extenſion of Commands what.</note> and integrity which Gods commands require of his people. By extenſion I meane the largeneſſe and elbow-roome, the bredth and reach of them. Both theſe make much to ſet forth their authority: For the former, Gods ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at which he aimes in commanding, which hee bindes by his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and arraignes at his Barre, for breaking them, is the conſcience of a man: hee ſets up his Rules in the ſecreteſt part of man, called in Scripture, the Spirit or inner man, of the moſt retired thoughts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. To this Cloſet no law of man can pierce, ſave God: he is the Lord of the bodies, but the ſoules are Gods peculiar: Hee requires indeed outward kiſſing the Sonne, and bowing the knee;<note place="margin">Jer. 31.31. Rom. 14.11.</note> but he more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over urges the due of the heart: There he will have his lawes written, even in the heart; and thence he will have obedience to flow. So <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 26. Rom. 7.22.25.</note> I delight in the Law of God in my inner man: And, whom I ſerve in my ſpirit.<note place="margin">Heb. 4.6.</note> The intents of the heart are pierced by this word and Law-giver: he judgeth the uprightneſſe, tenderneſſe, narrowneſſe, cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our obedience by the heart root: If it be planted there, even in the bent and ſtreame thereof: all is well, not elſe. Read Matth. 5.28. You have heard ſay of old, Thou ſhalt not commit adultery: But I ſay, He that luſteth after a woman, hath committed that ſinne in his heart. So that the Lord lookes at a pure principle, manner and ſcope
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:45715:281"/> of the heart, as well as the curbing of the outward man or members. Princes are mounted upon Thrones of Ivory or Gold: But the Lord onely exalts himſelfe in the ſpirit and conſcience; there he ſits as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne, and cauſes it to become his owne Recorder, witneſſe, and Judge, againſt the perſon himſelfe, ſo that the greateſt ſelfe-love in the world cannot bribe the conſcience to ſide with the ſinner againſt him who is the Lord of conſcience, and can condemne both the one &amp; the other.<note place="margin">1 John 3.20. Matth. 10.28.</note> Feare not him who can kill the body onely, but him who can caſt body and ſoule into hell fire, I ſay unto you, feare him. So then the Soveraignty of the commands of God, ſtands much in the intents of God, and that meaning of his to rule the ſpirits of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and in all their obedience, either negative or affirmative, either in doing or ſuffering, to caſt a ſecret chaine upon the conſcience, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey cheerfully, equally, uprightly, wiſely, conſtantly: For inſtance, in the worſhip of a Sabbath, the abhorring of oppreſſion, the ſuffering for the cauſe and truth of God; the Lord lookes not at the externall act, but the intent of the ſoule, and the pure carriage of the heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelfe, as with what delight it keepes a Sabbath, how cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially it preſerves the ſpirit chaſte and cleane, for what ends it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the croſſe, whether for Gods or it owne. Thus much for the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What is meant by the extent of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</note>The latter is, what is meant by the extent of a command? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, The full reach of the command. As for inſtance. Firſt, the unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitedneſſe of the command. The Lord makes not ſome Lawes for great ones, and ſome for ſmall ones; as if the great flye might get through the cobweb, but the little ones muſt be taken; but his nets as they are ſmall enough to catch the ſmall fiſh, ſo they are ſtrong enough to hold Whales and the mighteſt. They reach to all ſorts without limit, rich and poore, noble and ſimple, high and low, one and another. Secondly, their extent ſtands in their influence to all: The Princes law reaches to all his Subjects, as well as to his Chamber of London, but yet the law-giver reacheth no further then his preſence, in abſence, and behinde his backe his Lawes are ſlighted. But this Law-giver is omnipreſent, and aſſiſts his Lawes with immediate influence, cauſing them to convince in ſecret, as well as in publicke, and is able to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his owne Lawes to the uttermoſt, ſo that for lacke of ſtrength, and reach of arme, no ſinner can goe unpuniſhed. Thirdly, this breadth reaches in the affirmative command to the negative, and in the negative to the affirmative, as directly as if they had both been expreſſed: In the narrow Lawes of men, the ſenſe and ſcope of the Law muſt bee limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the words of the Statute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which (as the common ſpeech is) have no meaning in them beyond the tearmes thereof: But the power of Gods commands ſtands in their inſinuations, and imply ſomewhat by neceſſity which they expreſſe not. Fourthly, their extent ſtands in the coherence thereof, to wit, that whatſoever maine good or evill the Lord commands or forbids, by the ſame power, hee forbids or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands whatſoever concernes that command, the means tending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the occaſions leading, all circumſtances attending whatſoever poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly the ſoule of man can apprehend, directly or indirectly to make
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:45715:281"/> for that Law, or to thwart or croſſe that Law. Fifthly, it reaches to the quantity and meaſure of the duty, urging not only ſin to be ſhunned in the greateſt degree, but alſo in the ſmalleſt, and ſo, duty to be done, not only in the main peeces, but in the pettieſt, all proceeding from the ſame goodneſſe and juſtice. Sixthly, it reaches to the meaſure of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of obeying, urging it to obey, not coldly, deadly, ſlackly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, but to put forth the uttermoſt affection, ſtrength, wiſdome, will, courage, zeale, reach and largeneſſe, fruitfulneſſe and extenſion of the inward and outward man to concurre with the meaning of the Commander, which the Holy Ghoſt calls all welpleaſing, Col. 1.7. Seventhly, it reacheth to an univerſality of time, place, occaſions, not to be limited, ſtraitened and circumſcribed at our narrow will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but tyes us alway, yeſterday, to day and ever to one obedience,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.8.</note> not to vary with the time, with the multitude, by occaſion of dangers, feares, loſſes, enmity, power of man; not to be caſt off in private, in ſecret; but to be enlarged according to it ſelfe, generally, to all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. This is a field of matter, but I have already elſewhere walked in it in ſome ſort, as the reader hereof may perceive by that I have written in my practicall Catechiſme, part. 3. in the article of the directive rule of our obedience, the Law of God, where I treat fully of the point. So much for this ſecond.</p>
               <p>To theſe two queſtions, a third may be added, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> and anſwered ere we goe any further: and that is, that it may ſeem harſh to preſſe this point under the Goſpell, ſince that the liberty thereof takes off this ſtrictneſſe, and limits commands from the old extent of them, to the eaſe of the Goſpell. To the which I anſwer, That the Goſpell is ſo farre from that looſeneſſe, that rather it eſtabliſhes, <label type="milestone">

True it is, that the terror, rigor and the impoſſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Law is removed by our Lord Jeſus;<note place="margin">The Law how far its ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened or weakned by the Goſpell. 1 Tim. 1.5.6.</note> but looke what is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off in that kinde, is ſupplied in another; for the ſpiritualneſſe and purity of obeying is enlarged now, rather then diminiſhed; only it is true, that even in this enlargement the Lord Jeſus hath made his yoke moſt ſweet and eaſie to them who out of faith, love and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſeeke the end of the commandement, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes; of which more ſhall be occaſioned to ſpeake after, (if God will) in the uſe of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation. Its enough here to ſay, That as the Lord Jeſus hath remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that burdenſomeneſſe, tyranny and irkeſome rigor of Lawes, which was intollerable; ſo he hath put another yoke upon the ſoule inſtead thereof, which although love make ſweet, yet juſtice will not abate, nor cut off: Love made <hi>Iacobs</hi> labour welcome, but ſtill the froſt was tedious, and the heat weariſome,<note place="margin">Gen. 29.20.</note> and the conditions hard enough to fleſh and bloud.

For why? Gods commands admit no inquiry, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, ſhifts or excuſes; but require a free, reſolute, unlimited, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtioned ſubjection. So doe not mans. A Maſter cannot force the conſcience of his ſervant to what he pleaſeth, as if all the blame ſhould lye upon his necke, if the ſervant offend God in pleaſing man: No, for although the Maſter ſhall pay ſweetly for impoſing it, yet, ſo ſhall the ſervant alſo in venturing to obey a command uſurpedly impoſed, and therefore it imports him to enquire of the lawfulneſſe of the charge which his Maſter urgeth, except he will incurre the premunire of God and his penalties for tranſgreſſion: Its therefore both their duties to eſteeme their commands, and obedience thereto according to the rule of the Word, knowing that onely Gods commands are of themſelves, Law; other commands are ſo, ſo farre as they borrow their warrant from thence; and therefore ought to bee inquired into, ſcanned and debated before they be obeyed. I doe not intend to trench upon the poſitive civill power of Kings and Magiſtrates: I ſpeake of that uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Governours, whereby they take upon them to impoſe Laws upon inferiors, contrary to the commands of God.

               <p>So may I ſay of the Miniſter of a Congregation: Let him beware leſt he lend that authority and ſtrength which God hath put upon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<note place="margin">Miniſters muſt not proſtitute their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to urge or backe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands againſt God.

If any would abuſe thy place and perſon, to ſet up or bolſter any prophanations, liberties, or corruptions, which they cannot ſo well bolſter as thou mayſt, by the opinion which men have of thy learning, thy yeares and gravity, experience or gifts: Beware, and proſtitute not Gods commands to the baſeneſſe of men, ſet not thy conſcience to ſale to pleaſe men. If thy licentious Patrone, (who claimes an intereſt in thee) would borrow a priviledge from thee and thy Miniſtery, to live in luſt, uſury, oppreſſion, baſe pleaſures: If thy people would pull thee from thy zeale, and cloſeneſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to juſtifie them in the prophaning of Gods day, and the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a trumpet to that which fleſh of it ſelfe is too propenſe unto: Look to thy ſelfe, let not feare of loſing thine eſteeme with them, or their love; no, nor thy credit, thy living, thy peace and liberty of Miniſtery: Let not favour and flattery, to bee praiſed and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to bee a moderate man, draw thee on either hand to violate thy peace.</p>
               <p>Remember thoſe two fearfull paternes in Scripture,<note place="margin">1 King. 13.</note> which I ſhall mention: the one voluntary, the other compelled, but neither of them allowed by God. The former is, the example of that old Prophet, who knowing that the young Prophet (ſent by God to denounce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Altar and Idolatry of <hi>Ieroboam</hi>) was charged not to eate or drinke there, till he was returned home: yet would needs abuſe his authority and yeares to divert and controll Gods Command, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the young Prophet to returne, to breake his charge, and to eate and drinke at his houſe. No ſooner had hee perſwaded him ſo to doe, but the Lord ſent an <hi>item</hi> into his heart, to denounce againſt the young Prophet, that he ſhould dye for it: What a ſhame was that unto him?

Therefore it was juſt that his owne mouth ſhould pronounce ſentence, as againſt the other, ſo againſt himſelfe, for his inſolencie and uſurping againſt Gods ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne commands. But another inſtance I would alſo preſſe, who might ſeeme to be preſſed and provoked to doe the like; and yet eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped not cenſure. And this latter example I urge the rather upon this wretched age of wofull time-ſervers, with whom the prints of divine ſoveraignty in Commands, ſeemes to bee wholly worne out and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. If there bee any preſſure put upon Miniſters by their Patrones, People or Superiours, which trench upon the word, they preſently flye off from obeying a command according to it, and the ſoveraignty of it, and conſult with fleſh and blood, the conſequences of ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God: and if they finde, that it is like to become any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to their ſtate and liberty, they thinke it a very rationall thing to obey men before God. So wofully is that impreſſion of Gods ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Commands, blotted out in mens Conſciences,<note place="margin">Equivocating in point of Commands with conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of our owne skin, is abhominable.</note> that in very deed, the violating thereof is made but a ſport: and the outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects which men have to their name, eaſe, wealth and welfare, waſhes off all reſpects to Gods commands. Tuſh (ſay men) would you have us ruſh our ſelves upon the rockes, and upon the ſnares which are laid for us? Doe you thinke we are ſuch fooles as to betray our ſelves to

               <p>Secondly, becauſe they are held in and detained violently from that which they aime at: therefore, as a priſoner in his chaines, alway lies at the catch and opportunity to ſeeke his eſcape: ſo doe theſe, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any colour or evaſion, any ſhift or trick is offered, they cleanly and ſlily winde themſelves out of the authority of God.</p>

Take but one example hereof, recorded (I thinke) for the nonce, to ſcare all eluders and ſhifters with Gods Commands. And that is <hi>Balaam:</hi> who having his charge given him ſolemnly by the Lord, not to goe with thoſe meſſengers of <hi>Balac,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 22.19.</note> who came with bribes and preſents in their hands, to procure the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Sorcery and witch craft to curſe Iſrael: feeling himſelfe ſore pinched with this command, and yet having no reſt in his owne covetous heart, to forgoe the wages of iniquity: ſtudies how he might reconcile Gods ends and his owne: And, ſeeing that could not bee compaſſed, by a direct refuſall to goe; therefore firſt he bids the men ſtay till the morning; and in the meane while he ſo blind-folds his own eyes, as to dreame, that if God would give him leave to goe, he might goe. But what a deluding thought was that, when as his conſcience told him, God had denied it before? Well, by going to God to blanch over the matter, <hi>viz.</hi> That if he would give him leave to goe, he would doe no otherwiſe then he was bidden; the Lord connives at his going: And what doth he? He takes it very gladly,<note place="margin">Verſe 20.21</note> and makes uſe of it; but from whence is it that he doth ſo? Surely from no other bottome, ſave this, that by his going, hee hoped (one way or other) to attaine thoſe ends, which elſe hee knew he ſhould not; whereas (if hee had meant truely) he would have abhorred ſuch an occaſion as laid a blocke in his way to fall at.

And was he ſenſible of himſelfe in all this his race? No, but ſtill impudently, tels God (when he ſaw there was no remedy) he would goe backe, if he might not go? What was that, but to upbraid God for reſiſting him, having before given him leave? And ſo he proceeded in his journey, and ſought divinations, that is, caſt about with himſelfe how he might curſe the people, and get his ends: And, when the Lord croſſed him ſtill, yet (to ſhew what mettall he was made of) rather then he would loſe his booty, he adviſes <hi>Baalac</hi> how to procure God to curſe them by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking them to Idolatry and uncleanneſſe: And this was the whole courſe of this Hypocrite in croſſing the command of God; having once won ground for himſelfe by his firſt trick, lo, he hardens him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo faſt in his treachery, that he ſees not his owne hypocriſie:
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:45715:285"/> And what was his end?

And theſe briefly may be ſummed up in theſe heads following. Firſt, hypocrites caſt off pinching commands, by denying and avoiding the truth and realneſſe of the command:<note place="margin">1. By avoiding the realneſſe of commands.</note> And thus many ſhunne the dint of a ſpirituall command to keepe the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath holy, by denying the whole morality of it, and calling the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the fourth Commandement into queſtion and ſcruple, that ſo under that buckler, they may walke on deſperately and ſenſleſly in the breaking of it, whether Miniſters by not preaching, or people by not ſanctifying it. Secondly, by a baſe ſhifting off the knowledge of a command,<note place="margin">2. Shifting off the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them.</note> that having no knowledge thereof, they might lurk in their diſobedience the more ſweetly. Thus Joh. 3.20. They who hate the light, come not at it, that ſo they may lurke as unconvinced of their own ſinne, which (if convinced) they muſt needs abandon. So alſo thoſe Jewes, who being urged by our Saviour to anſwer whether the Miniſtery of <hi>Iohn</hi> were from heaven or from men?<note place="margin">Marke 11.31.</note> They conſulted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether thus, If we ſay it was from heaven, he will aske, why then did you not beleeve it? If from men, the people will ſtone us, ſeeing all held <hi>Iohn</hi> to be a Prophet. They reſolve therefore to anſwer, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell; which though it were falſe, and a deluding of their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,<note place="margin">3. By dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing their extent.</note> yet, they waſht their hands of it the more eaſily. Thirdly, if they needs acknowledge commands in ſpite of them, yet they take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and diminiſh from the extent of a command, and limit it to a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower extent then it reaches unto.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.5.</note> Thus <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were content to abridge the ſtrictneſſe of the charge, and to reſtraine it as themſelves pleaſed, adding a peradventure to Gods abſoluteneſſe; and ſo of an whole charge they made but halfe an one. Thus the Phariſees by their Sophiſtry cut off the ſpirituall part of the morall Law,<note place="margin">Matth. cap. 5.6.7.</note> and they limited it to the outward act, by which they eſtabliſhed their own eaſe in the keeping thereof literally.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4. By oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of one command to another. Matth. 15.4.</note>Fourthly, when they are beaten off here then they ſhunne a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand by oppoſing one againſt another, that ſo they may deſtroy both. And thus did thoſe Phariſees by their Corban: They imagined that it
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:45715:285"/> could not be denied but there was good uſe of offering to holy ends, and it ſeemed a pious act for a child to nurſe a decayed parent: Now for their private Corban, they diſcharge the child from his obedience to father or mother, (as Papiſts doe at this day debarre parents of their children, by ſnaring them with vowes againſt their conſent) whereas firſt it ſhould be decided whether of the two commands were moſt neceſſary to bee done? That ſo the one might give place, the other might prevaile. Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. By falſe plea of preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</note> hypocrites ſhunne the dint of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands by falſe plea of preſidents, and examples of ſuch as God hath diſpenced with (in ſome ſpeciall caſes) and therefore, ſay they, why may not we bee ſpared aſwell as ſuch? A ſome have ſtollen other goods, ſome have been tollerated in their officious lies,<note place="margin">See Gen. 30.39.41.42.</note> others have beene allowed other liberties, or at leaſt been connived at and pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them; why not they aſwell? Whereas ſome of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are facts of boldneſſe, and preſumptuous pollicy,<note place="margin">Exod. 1.19.20.</note> 1 Sam. 20.6. as <hi>Davids</hi> anſwer to <hi>Abimeles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ex. 12.35.36.</note> and the apology which he put into <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathans</hi> head, to ſtop <hi>Sauls</hi> mouth withall: Others although God win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at, yet he allowed not. Sixtly, hypocrites elude the force of Gods commands by the adding of new commands, which God never made,<note place="margin">6. By adding of new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of their owne.</note> as ſuppoſing that hereby they may well be ſpared from obeying ſuch as God hath commanded. And this is an old and beaten way of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, to load themſelves with outward burdens and impoſts of their owne, that they may ſeeme to be farre from them that breake com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: They will not ſpare their fleſh, but impoſe more then God could finde in his heart to impoſe; If he call for an hin of oyle or wine, they will offer him whole Baths and Buts thereof,<note place="margin">Mica 6.</note> yea rivers and floods; if God require of them a faſt once by the weeke, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ey will faſt twice, if he appoint them a ſacrifice of their flocke,<note place="margin">Luke 18.12.</note> a ſheep or bullocke, they will outvie him, and offer him the fruit of their owne loines and wombes in ſacrifice; by which ſuperogating, they doubt not, but to be accounted through-obeyers of his owne commands; and by this pollicy our Papiſts and formall worſhippers, at this day ſubſiſt, and juſtifie themſelves, imagining themſelves to be worthy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedients to commands, becauſe they deviſe ſo many which God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dreamt of. But you muſt conſider in the meane while, that the commands which themſelves deviſe may bee obeyed by their owne ſtrength and power, and ſerve to while and keepe them occupied that Gods commands may be diſpenced withall: They are no ſuch great friends of voluntary, as they are ſworne foes of neceſſary commands: As it was ſaid of <hi>Ottomans</hi> horſe, That where he once ſet his feet, graſſe would no more grow after; ſo where the devotions of theſe hypocrites take place, Religion and the power of godlineſſe wanze and periſh. Laſtly, hypocrites corrupt the authority of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, by excepting and cavilling againſt the ſtrictneſſe thereof,<note place="margin">7. By cavilling at the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them.</note> with carnall probabilities &amp; reaſons of their owne. Fleſh inclines to liberty, and when once that can be eſtabliſht, each pretence running in the ſtreame of fleſh, makes it ſeeme to be reaſonable. There is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God but admits ſome colour and objection of a carnall heart to gainſay it. But of this in the next Branch.</p>
               <pb n="532" facs="tcp:45715:286"/>
               <p>But to apply this Branch alſo with Terror, conſider, Oh ye hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, who have ſo many wayes to croſſe Gods commands, and to nible off here one peece thereof, there another, till you have quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowne all;<note place="margin">Application of this ſecond.</note> whether (I ſay) ever any prevailed againſt God who contended with him about the ſoveraignty of his Prerogative? Shall he not moſt righteouſly condemne all ſuch?<note place="margin">Eſay 54. ult.</note> Was there ever any that reſiſted God and proſpered? Shall not this be the condemnation of the world,<note place="margin">John. 3.19.</note> that light came, but they hid themſelves from it, and all, becauſe their workes are evill? Is it not juſt, that thoſe who winke with their eyes, and will not ſee, ſhould be left to themſelves, to be ſtone blinde?<note place="margin">Act. 28.</note> That their hearts ſhould bee as hard as brawne, ſo that they ſhould be ſenſeleſſe of the wrath which hangs over them? Doe we thinke all thoſe woes denounced againſt phariſees and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites ſhall rot in the skie? Such as by their owne traditions have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Law of God, and neither will enter themſelves, nor ſuffer them that would to goe to Heaven? Who hate with deadly feud all ſuch as reſiſt their inventions, and would not only draw bloud from them, but even ſhed their heart bloud and bowells to the earth if they could? Shall not all the bloud of them which they have ſpilt from the bloud of <hi>Abel</hi> to this day, be required of them? Shall not the Lord turne backe upon them all thoſe obtruded worſhips of theirs,<note place="margin">Matth. 23. ult.</note> as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome? Shall not all their labours be forfeit? What a terror ſhould this be to all Popiſh phariſees, that when they looke for deepe thanke from God for the high ſervice they have thought to have done, hee ſhall choke them with their owne morſells, and grudge them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with till they come out at their noſtrills? What is ſo fearfull as to lay heaps upon heaps, and dye of thirſt? To hear God anſwer them &amp; ſay, Who requireth theſe things at your hands? Let them who ſet you on worke pay you your wages? To loſe the day at Law, is ſome ſorrow: But to loſe the day in the ſolemne judgement of God, and to he ſent to thoſe Idolls, inventions and devotions, which they ſet up in Gods roome, which cannot helpe them, how fearefull will it be? When the Lord ſhall ſay, Bring me but the entire obedience of heart to one of my Commands, to my Sabbaths, to my Sacraments; prove but this one thing, that you have walked humbly and meekly with God, that you have kept your ſelves unſpotted of the world, ſerved your time and generation wiſely, abſtained from fleſhly luſts, abhorred form, &amp; clave to the power of godlineſſe, and I will ſave you: But alas! not one drop or dram of ſuch obedience can be brought forth: Tell me how juſt and righteous ſhall ye your ſelves confeſſe your condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be? Surely you ſhall be ſpeechleſſe: Here you confound o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with your terrors, and make them ſo, but there your ſelves ſhall be ſo confounded, that you ſhall be ſtrucke dumbe, and not be able to gainſay; nay you ſhall ſubſcribe to your owne doome.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O proceed (Brethren) where we left laſt,<note place="margin">3. Branch. The cunning and colours of hypocrites to ſhift off Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</note> and to conclude this Uſe of Terror; let us alſo (in the third place) obſerve by what ſhifts and cunning theſe hypocrites elude Gods Commands; even with Arguments ſuggeſted by their carnall reaſon, which is as a ſpring never drawne dry, affoording them ſtill one pretence after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all parts and points of duty occaſioned unto them. Take but two or three examples in this kinde: Firſt,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 13.8 14. 1. Inſtance.</note> thoſe two acts of <hi>Saul</hi> recorded in the thirteenth and fifteenth Chapters of the firſt of <hi>Samuel.</hi> Then that other of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> about the thirteenth of the firſt of Kings. For the former, God commands <hi>Saul</hi> not to meddle with ſacrificing or ſanctifying the battell till <hi>Samuel</hi> came. For the more deep triall what honeſty was in his heart, the Lord detaines <hi>Samuel</hi> longer then the dayes appointed, and what doth <hi>Saul?</hi> Surely he falles to offer ſacrifice himſelfe. When <hi>Samuel</hi> comes, hee askes him what hee had done? Hee telles him, he had given the adventure to breake the charge; but he was moved thereto by weighty motives. Firſt, <hi>Samuel</hi> came not within the limited ſpace, and that ſeemed to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe him to offer ſacrifice, and to releaſe the charge. Then ſecondly, <hi>Samuel</hi> was but a ſubject, a man unskilfull in the affaires and ſeaſons of warre: himſelfe was a Martiall man, of great wiſedome in that kinde, and therefore in ſo doubtfull a caſe, fitter to determine what was to be done. Thirdly, the Philiſtines were now come upon him, and he was unprepared; ſo that, had he not beſtir'd him, they might in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood have ſuddenly ſurprized him. Fourthly, the ſouldiers that hee had, were ſlipt away from him upon <hi>Samuels</hi> delay, and ſo hee was in
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:45715:287"/> perill to be deſerted, and to lacke ſtrength. Fifthly, hee was very reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and devout, in that he would not ſuffer the Sacrifice and Prayer to be neglected, notwithſtanding the danger. Sixthly, it ſeemed to croſſe ſome other commands of God, to deſiſt from ſacrificing at that inſtant, and not to haſten it. For why? The ſtaying upon <hi>Samuels</hi> comming, had been to preferre Sacrifice before Mercy to mens lives. Seventhly, it ſeemed to croſſe Providence, when God had offered an opportunity of fight, upon better conditions, to neglect it, and to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon more unequall termes afterward: Theſe and many more cavils hee pretended: But none of them could (notwithſtanding the colourableneſſe thereof) prevaile againſt an expreſſe command: and therefore <hi>Samuel</hi> denounceth againſt him, that in all theſe paſſages of his carnall wiſedome, he was but afoole, and ſhould bee ſtript of his Kingdome. God knew well enough what ſtraits he was in, &amp; yet knew alſo, that he had experience ſufficient of Gods power, in all theſe ſtraits (if he had not had a baſe heart of treachery) which could have ſtood between him and his feares: ſo that he ſhould not have needed to have fallen to his ſhifts.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Inſtance. 1 Sam. 15.3.</note>The other inſtance of <hi>Saul</hi> is in Chap. 15. There the Lord betru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted him the ſecond time with another cloſe tryall of his loyall heart, putting him upon the deſtruction of <hi>Amalek,</hi> commanding him not to ſpare any, old, young, high or low, fat or leane, but to kill all. One would have thought that the former triall had been a watchword ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; but a baſe heart will be baſe when all is done: therefore in that buſineſſe alſo, he faulters fearfully; killing the baſer and meaner ſort of people, the leane and worthleſſe cattell: but keeping the richer ſort of people, and the fat cattle alive. Now, when <hi>Samuel</hi> comes to him to take an account, what doth hee? Hee magnifies his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at the firſt; but by and by being convinced of his falſhood, hee falles to dawbing with untempered mortar. Doubtleſſe, the bottome was a covetous heart, turning after the ſpoile: but he had colours enow to defend it. For why? Was not the killing of ſo many fat cattell (in ſhew) a prejudice to mercie, ſince that they might have filled many hungry bellies? Yea, and to piety alſo, ſince they might have made many a ſacrifice to God? But alas! to plead mercy or ſacrifice againſt a charge, is to bee wiſer then God, that is, a ſtarke foole. And ſo was he. The like were his other trickes: That the people reſerved them: And, he feared their violence if hee had reſiſted them: (a very lye; for they feared him extreamly, as appeares by the vow which hee bound them in, Chap. 14.) But could all theſe ſhifts profit him? No ſurely: Hee was convinced to be hollow, and then threatned the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time with the loſſe of his Kingdome for the breach of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 12.26.</note>The ſecond inſtance is <hi>Ieroboam:</hi> God gave him his charge to keepe his ſtatutes, and promiſed to make him a ſure Kingdome. What doth he? As ſoone as he had gotten into the ſaddle, what thoughts doth he apprehend? Surely, leaving the promiſe of eſtabliſhing his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he caſts with himſelfe what would follow upon the going up of the ten Tribes to Jeruſalem to worſhip: hee imagined, that it would
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:45715:287"/> prove an occaſion of ſtealing away their hearts to the government of Juda: and therefore he gives God over, warps to himſelfe a better way of ſafety, ſets up two Calves in Dan and Bethel, to keep the people at home. And what (thinke wee) were his pretences? Very many. For why? Was there no other place might ſerve to worſhip in, ſave one? Did not <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 21.33. Gen. 26.25. Gen. 35.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> ſet up their Altars and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God? Nay, were there not Altars built in Canaan by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, and by the two Tribes and an halfe? And did not <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> build an Altar by occaſion of the Philiſtines invaſion? And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, what? Was it not equall, that he, being a King called by God, (as well as <hi>Rehoboam</hi>) might ordaine a place for his ſubjects to worſhip God as well as he? Did God by name forbid this,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 7.9.</note> or tye him to the Temple? And moreover, if God had ſo delighted in the Temple-worſhip, would he have cut off the Kingdome from the houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and ſetled it upon him? Beſides all this, what? Could nothing content men but the Temple? Hee did not ſet up his Calves againſt the Temple, but for the worſhip of the true God: If indeed hee had done it for idolatry, it were ſinfull; but he ordained it for God. And as for thoſe reſemblances of Calves, which hee deviſed, why? Was not the Temple full of Lyons and Cherubims, and ingraven formes? And to conclude, although a Prophet came to denounce againſt his Altars, yet was he not devoured by a Lyon? And his ſonne <hi>Abijah,</hi> who would not cloſe with his Idols, died hee not an untimely death? And did not he ſurvive and proſper by this worſhip of his? Lo, what a world of trickes and ſhifts hee could alledge! But nothing could ſerve his turne againſt ſo ſtrict a charge as the ſecond Command, wherewith hee ſtood charged, ſtill the wrath of God purſued him, and cut him off at length, making him a very by-word, <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Nebat,</hi> who made Iſrael to ſinne. So that, let hypocrites turne themſelves into never ſo many colours; and ſcrue themſelves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſubtilly into their diſtinctions, they doe but ſo much the more incenſe God againſt them, and provoke him to unmaske and diſcover them to the world, to be ſuch as they are, till unavoidable deſtruction at laſt come upon them.</p>

                  <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> (thoſe ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious hypocrites) had firſt conſented to bee of the forwardeſt in zeale to the Churches ſervice: And, they would ſell all, and lay it at the Apoſtles feet. After, through temptation of Satan, they conſulted to keepe away a part of the price, and yet pretended to give all. What thinke we? Had they not colours? Yes doubtleſſe. For why? Did all ſell their eſtates for the Church? Or, did many give ſuch a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as they gave, (who yet perhaps had as great meanes?) And was it not well that they did as they did? Or, did God urge more from them then they could well ſpare? Should they ſo ſuccour others as to undoe and endanger themſelves? Or, could conſequent difficulties at the firſt ſo appeare, as they did after? Or could they well change their tale to the Apoſtles, after it was once given out that they had ſold all? Would not that have diſcredited their zeale? All theſe are faire colours: But for all theſe, foraſmuch as the pinch of the command of

Oh! the hollow heart ſhrugges and ſhrinkes at the extent of Commands; cannot endure to thinke them larger then it ſelfe is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to doe them. If ſhe ſhould heare of a rule of more cloſeneſſe then ſhe can admit, ſhe muſt needs bewray her ſelfe, which ſhe is loth to do. Oh! how deſirous a baſe heart is to get abatements of commands. There is no man ſo forward to urge the uttermoſt allowance of the weight of gold, that his light peeces might paſſe for currant; as an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite craves ſtill for allowance to his ſlight obedience. It kils his heart to heare of the ſtrictneſſe of a Sabbath, what the rules of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Faſt are, to prepare himſelfe to the Sacrament, to heare the Word, to deny himſelfe, to be tied to doe, or take good in company, to walke unſpotted of the world, to oppreſſe none by fraud, uſury, hardneſſe: Alas! his Trade lies in this kinde, take him off that &amp; you kill him. See 1 King. 22. <hi>Ahab</hi> being urged to call for a Prophet of God, ſent for him: But as the Meſſenger went for him, in his returne hee entreats him that his words might bee like the words of the foure hundred Prophets: and that hee would not bee too ſtrict. But the cloſer obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is a cloſe inquirer, like <hi>Micaja,</hi> who would not bee pulled to the
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:45715:290"/> right or left hand from God; he is a willing perſon to bee informed about the nakedneſſe and ſimplicity of commands, deſirous to know the hardeſt. Thus <hi>Iob</hi> cap. 34. and verſe 32. ſaith, If I faile that which I ſee not, doe thou teach me: Thus <hi>David,</hi> Search me O Lord and try me, if there be any way of evill in me: Not, that they have not much corruption, and come farre ſhort; but yet they have no treacherous heart of withdrawing, but rather an entire affection to be equall to Commands: And as the heart of an hypocrite doth infinitely diſobey: So, the ſoule of a beleever hath a boundleſſe unlimited deſire to obey a word, according to a word, in which regard its called a perfect heart, becauſe it would be ſo, and mournes that it cannot; as a naturall childe is troubled that it cannot doe the fathers will to the full, and therefore doth what it can to the uttermoſt. Try we our ſelves then in this: Do we wiſh that the rule were crooked, that we might crooke our owne way? Doe we tremble and ſtart at the cloſeneſſe of Gods ſoveraigne Commands, ſaying, Theſe are hard things, who then ſhall be ſaved? Its a ſigne we are hollow; and if we could, we would bee willingly ignorant,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.5.6.</note> that we might live the ſweet life of an ideot: But, doe wee preſſe after light, information, reſolution, and when we have it wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it and obey it?

Are we willing (upon better information) to undoe our errors, to beginne againe anew, rather then we would ſtill erre? Surely its a ſigne of an honeſt heart, cloſing with Commands?</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Triall. </seg>2</label> Secondly, an honeſt obeyer of Commands, hath a ſpeciall tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart,<note place="margin">She is tender to obey.</note> and ſoundneſſe of judgement, to diſcerne and to cloſe with commands, to abhorre and to abandon the contrary. I may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a cloſe heart in theſe two,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> to a skilfull muſitian, and to the tender ey-lid. A muſitian that hath exact skill on the lute or viall, will lay his eare to the ſtrings, and by his quicke diſcerning will preſently finde out the leaſt jarre of his diſtuned inſtrument. Another man would judge that there is very good muſicke, but he cannot reſt ſo content, but ſtill is putting downe, or winding up his pinne and ſtring till his eare bee pleaſed. Oh! there be many ſecret jarres in the ſpirit of a good Soule, which others ſee not, and therefore applaud, and commend; but hee cannot allow himſelfe in them; he counts not himſelfe thereby ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, he diſcernes the jarre of his heart (though others like his mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke never ſo) and perceives which way his heart windes, and doubles, flagges and faulters; as in keeping of a Sabbath, in hearing the Word, in the end and ſcope of his actions, and is never well till his heart be in tune: And ſo it is with him in his affection, his heart ſmites him for that jarre: as <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> having wound in himſelfe into an Idolatrous company, and hearing his foure hundred Prophets flatter him, could not be quiet,<note place="margin">1 King. 22.7.</note> but ſtarted at it (as a man out of his place) Is there not here (ſaith he) ever a Prophet of the Lord to conſult with? So <hi>David</hi> having cut off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24.5.</note> checked himſelfe, and ſmote his heart for it. As I ſaid, it is with a good heart, as with the ey-lid; which being given to cover the curious eye, is ſo tender, that if the leaſt mote touch the eye, it cannot endure it, but twinckles and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:45715:290"/> inſtantly. Try thy ſelfe then by this rule: If thou feele Gods Commands with a furr'd glove on thy fingers, and as one would feele the leaſt needle with a cloath about this hand: if thou goe to worke groſſely with commands, it muſt be a very great and large one which thou feeleſt, but as for the leſſer, and narrower ones, thou haſt no ſenſe thereof, (as in truth an hypocrite cannot reach the ſpiritualneſſe of any Command) thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe what thou art: But if thou ſet the Commands of God in the cloſſet of thy ſoule, if thou haſt a tender, ſenſible feeling of all thy jars and cavills with the Commands of God, if thou ſtart at the leaſt appearance of evill, aſwell as thoſe evills which will waſte, and gull downe thy conſcience, its a marke of an heart tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloſing with Commands.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, its a very good ſigne of a cloſe heart, if having beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Triall. </seg>3</label> once by the ſweet of a ſurfetting ſinne,<note place="margin">It profits in obedience by experience of former diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying.</note> the ſoule have enough and too much of it for ever after. If a tender ſtomacke have overſhot it ſelfe with exceſſe in ſome diſh of meat, commonly nature will doe penance all the life after, and loath that diſh. Seldome doe we read, that the Saints fell into the ſame ſinnes, which once they paid for. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> returned no more to his uncleanneſſe, <hi>Hezechia</hi> to his pride of life; <hi>Peter</hi> to his denying of his Maſter. Try thy ſelfe then by this. If thou make a falling ſickneſſe of thy ſinnes, and art alway complaining, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſgracing of a ſin, but yet falleſt into it againe as often, thy heart is either unſound, or unguarded: I grant that <hi>Beelzebub</hi> will light againe often upon the place which he is beaten from; but I ſpeake of a defiledneſſe of heart, conſenting to that which it ſeems much to whine and complaine of. For ſurely a good heart is alway in combat againſt any ſinne, but above all againſt her moſt knowne naturall corruptions, her eye is alway upon them, they make her as the fiſh out of her ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, quaking for feare. No hectique diſpoſition upon the body ſo ſapes away the ſtrength thereof, as the feare of a ſinne formerly foiling the ſoule, makes it fearefull of it, yea it nouriſheth in it ſelfe a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all antipathy, and enmity with it. Many may be her ſtaggers, but ſtill ſhe lies in watch and wait againſt them, and all the opportunities, occaſions and inducements unto them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, an honeſt heart hath a ſenſible joy in it ſelfe, that there is <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Triall. </seg>4</label> a word of God to decide the queſtion between her and her ſinne:<note place="margin">In caſes of queſtion ſhe is glad that the word may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide it.</note> Be the colours of a baſe luſt never ſo ſtrong and many, yet the ſoule is glad to heare, that neither it ſelfe, nor yet her corruption muſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the caſe, but that the word muſt and can beare ſway.

                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 14.41.</note> The Lord give a perfect lot. This is a ſigne that although the heart might poſſibly be blinded by ignorance in ſome caſe, yet ſincerity is ſtil alive; becauſe it can rejoice to hear the cauſe of God pleaded againſt her owne; and can finde in her heart to abandon the moſt pretious luſt, rather then the leaſt tittle of Gods commands ſhould periſh. He who hath an ill cauſe loves not to heare of an equall bearing by impartiall Arbitrators: But he whoſe cauſe is good, or at leaſt who loves peace, is more troubled with the controverſie, then tickled with the gaine; and therefore bindes himſelf to ſtand to award, and is glad that there is any way to make an end.</p>
               <pb n="542" facs="tcp:45715:291"/>
               <p>Fifthly, the honeſt heart cares alway more for the preſervation of the integrity of Commands, then for her owne ſafety and ends. She <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Triall. </seg>5</label> is like herein to the harlot whoſe the child was, 1 King. 3. end. The falſe mother hearing <hi>Salomon</hi> call for a ſword to divide the childe,<note place="margin">She prefers the ſafety of the Command before her owne skin.</note> looked onely at her owne ends, to be as the other woman was; but in the meane time ſhe diſcovered her owne unnaturalneſſe, and that the childe was none of her owne. But the true mother who knew the coſt and price of her child, could not endure the cutting of it aſunder, but cried, Give her rather the child, then it ſhould be ſlaine. Juſt ſo is it here: A baſe heart, never bred by the grace of the Spirit, to obey Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, rejoices when it ſelfe, and the word may have ſhare, and ſhare like; is glad to ſee the word mangled, and that God ſhould have one peece of his will and ſhe another. But a cloſe ſoule obeying Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, is of a farre other frame; for ſhe hath been bred of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall ſeed of the word, lien in the wombe, felt the warmth, and drawne the breaſts of it, and lives and growes by it: Therefore ſhee cannot endure to ſee it divided, wreſted, abuſed, and cut in two; rather ſhe is content to abhorre herſelfe, her owne ends and reſpects, and cries, O Lord, let not the childe be hurt, rather let my will bee caſt in the dirt. This is a ſad triall indeed; let us come to the ſcanning of it: While Gods and our ſtreame may be ſuffered to runne in one chanell, we eaſily give way to God: But, if it ſo fall out, that he will not ſuffer our dung to ſwimme with his Apples, but if we will goe in his ſtream, we muſt goe in it meerly, onely our luſts muſt bee renounced; nay, perhaps ſo the caſe ſtands, that even our lawfull liberties muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, our lives, healths, gifts, contents, eaſe, elbowroom, credit and ſway, muſt be ſhaken off, to obey a Command; and thoſe who would perſwade us (as <hi>Peter</hi> did Chriſt) to pitty our ſelves,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.25.</note> muſt bee rated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and forſaken, wife, childe, friend, counſellor, people, Miniſter, who come in and tel us, if you ſuffer, and obey God, farewell the eaſe of our life, farewell the jollity of our towne, our ſhops, trades, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, revenewes, credits, contents: Oh!

An hypocrite upbraids God, as for his doings, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 58.6. ſo for his ſufferings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.24. Hee thinkes God to be bound and beholden to him for them: and if hee either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard him not in the one, or reward him not for the other, hee thinkes himſelfe wronged. Contrarily, a cloſe obeyer counts his reward to ſtand in his obedience, that God will account him worthy, either to doe or ſuffer for him.<note place="margin">Acts 4.22.23.</note> And if he loſe either his will and baſe luſts by the one, or his credit, health, wealth, or friends by the other, he lookes at the promiſe of an hundred fold, grounded upon Gods alſufficiency and faithfulneſſe. A notable text we have 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.9. when the Prophet forbad <hi>Amaziah</hi> to goe fight with his enemies: his objection was, That he had hired Souldiers of Iſrael for ſome thouſands of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents: how ſhould he doe for thoſe? The Prophet tells him, The Lord could abundantly reſtore thoſe Talents.</p>
               <p>Brethren, we would ſuffer perhaps for God: but then (as it was with <hi>Amaziah</hi>) theſe Talents are the ſorrow of all: hence comes our unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to ſuffer. But as the Prophet ſaid, ſo ſay I, The Lord can make them good: doe but truſt him. Affliction is a bitter herbe; but it beares a ſweet flower, and ſweeter fruit. Give the Lord thy Talents, and thou ſhalt have an hundred fold backe againe. Theſe loſſes which thou feareſt, thy wife, thy children, thy contents, give them up to God, truſt him with them, and he will refine them all for thee, that thou ſhalt receive them at his hands purer and cleaner, (not to ſay greater and fuller) then ever before. Thoſe vapours which the Sunne exhales from the earth, loſe nothing by it, for they are ſo altered in the ayre, that they come downe againe more fruitfull upon the earth, then ever. So, if God have once tryed thee in this furnace, all ſhall come forth purer then ever. The daughters of affliction are the faireſt of all other. There were no ſuch women for beauty as <hi>Iobs</hi> three daughters were after his affliction. He himſelfe was purer, and ſo was all he had:<note place="margin">Job ult.</note> and as affliction is a furnace, ſo is it a banque: <hi>Iob</hi> had twice as much after he had loſt all, as before: No trade ſo gainfull as this of the Croſſe: a man that hath had the experience of it, gaines twice ſo much, nay an hundred times more then he had before: I ſay not temporally, (and
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:45715:292"/> yet God is alſufficient) but ſpiritually, to all that ſuffer meekly and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently. Caſt off therefore the clog of theſe Talents both from thy heart and thy heeles, which do ſo hang on, and oppreſſe, and truſt God, and he ſhall make them good.</p>
               <p>Let us try our ſelves in this caſe: Put caſe we deny our ſelves in our paſſions and diſtempers of wife, ſervants in the family, when we bee provoked: ſurely we thinke our ſelves to loſe our owne will, and the ſatisfying of our luſts, which is as our life: what ſhall we have for it? Surely the peace of God,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> paſſing all underſtanding ſhall rule our hearts: we ſhall be more then conquerours, and the ſweetneſſe of the love of Chriſt (for whoſe cauſe we doe deny our ſelves) ſhall bee ſufficient boot in beame to pacifie us:<note place="margin">Judg. 9.</note> wee would not forſake our fatneſſe and ſweetneſſe for an humour, to exalt our ſelves; rather wee would deny our ſelves, to keepe that precious pearle unſtained. Can wee then reſt in this pay? Do we chuſe rather to picke out the myſtery of this hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold, and to improve it by faith, then wee will forfeit our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Do we chuſe rather to maintaine our liberty with God in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, in prayer, in a quiet conſcience, then we would breake a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? Would wee endure the greateſt evill of puniſhment, rather then be guilty of the leaſt knowne evill? It is a good ſigne. So I ſay alſo in our ſufferings; perhaps we ſee our ſelves ſlighted and diſregar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by men for our ſervice to God; yea, thoſe who awe us moſt, doe unthankfully (if not trecherouſly) handle us; our labour ſeemes to bee loſt, and we are left to ſinke in our owne charges. Can we now in this caſe commit our ſelves freely to the promiſe of God, and ſay, Though there be neither calfe left in the ſtall,<note place="margin">Hab. 3.</note> nor bullocke in the flocke, yet we will ſtill rejoyce in God our ſalvation? When the wife in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome is not to bee truſted (as <hi>Micah</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mica 7.5.</note> ſpeakes) when a guide, a friend, prove unfaithfull, and our enemy is one, of our owne Tribe, familiarity, houſhold? Can wee then truſt in God, and make him our ſtrength? Can we finde ſap and ſavour in a promiſe of Gods ſupport, whether he ſeeme to anſwer our prayers or not, yea, though in ſtead of releeving us, he adde ſorrow to ſorrow, and give our enemies the better of us? Can we make ſongs of him in our pilgrimage, and finde a realneſſe in his promiſes, when nothing appeares, ſave that God leaves us, to ſinke under our burdens? Surely it may appeare then, that our hearts are cloſe in our obedience.</p>

The guiſe of this world of hypocrites, is contrary: For the former, when the queſtion is, touching the ſubſtance of reading, hearing, prayer, Sacrament, wee colour over our unwillingneſſe with ſome by-cavils. Being urged to read good bookes, they cavill and ſay, They are too deep and too lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned form our underſtandings; as if wee would read them if they were plaine: whereas the bookes are plaine enough, but wee have no heart. Being urged to heare a good Preacher, wee alledge, wee conceive not his method. If we be bidden to frequent ſuch a good Congregation, we ſay, we cannot endure to bee ſo crowded and thronged. If to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch examples, we anſwer, they are too eminent for us to follow:
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:45715:292"/> whereas indeed, as once one anſwered, when he was urged to doe ſome good with his great wealth; The thing you urge is good, but I have no heart to it: ſo, we want an heart. So, when wee are called to ſerve God in our time, to faſt and pray, we cavill, That it is dangerous; and therfore we crave pardon: whereas the Lord calls us to ſerve him with all our ſtrength and courage, not onely in ſafe and eaſie duties, but even in ſuch as hypocrites count dangerous and offenſive. Try we our ſelves then by this Rule. If we profeſſe to ſerve and obey God even in thoſe duties for which the world loves not, with <hi>Paul</hi> we be not aſhamed to make them the beſt and faireſt flower of our garlands, it is a ſigne of cloſeneſſe and honeſty. See Acts 23. I ſay, if wee bee willing to bend our ſelves to our uttermoſt wiſedome and ability to obey, rather then through feare to give God the ſlip, it ſpeakes well for us. That which the world counts evill, I am not aſhamed to ſay, I worſhip God by.</p>

For example, it is Gods Command that we follow our Callings, That we puniſh ſin when we can, whereſoever it lies. Now marke: Wee feele our ſelves prompt enough (perhaps) to follow our work and buſineſſe, becauſe it runnes in the ſtreame of our commodity, and therefore wee will not be idle: So againe, it falles out, that hee whom we purſue for his offences, is our enemy; and therefore we are eaſily drawne to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue him. Here therefore the triall is, if we can by evident Arguments prove, that as wee are not drawne to leave the duty for the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to our owne ends: ſo yet we doe the duty from a ſuperiour prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Conſcience. As for example; though we ſhould get nothing by our preaching, yet wee would chuſe to preach rather then deſiſt. And, as we purſue our enemy, ſo would wee alſo our friend, if he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in like caſe. This is a good marke. For why? hypocrites are very glad when Gods and their ends concurre: As the dung ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the ſame ſtreame with the Apples, ſaid, We Apples ſwimme. But when wee can ſeparate the pretious from the vile, and call dung dung; and Apples Apples, it is well. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayd well, God bids me preach; but I feele my ſelfe to pleaſe mine owne humour in it: God wills me to ſhine; and lo, I feele that I ſhine to my ſelfe: Therefore, as I will not ceaſe ſhining for this reaſon, ſo yet I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſo to ſhine to others in holy life, that I may not therewith ſhine to my ſelfe by pride.</p>

For the former thus: Are Gods charges ſo cloſe, ſo ſpirituall, ſo binding? Surely then the courſe of this world is very blame-worthy, for that loves nothing ſave liberty and diſpenſations.

The courſe of ſuch among us as have written or preached ſome abatements to our former Tenets and Articles of Doctrine, allaying and corrupting our principles of juſtification, free grace, and other the like, hath brought forth this baſtard fruit, and Papiſts dare publiquely write books in the reconciling of our Doctrine in this Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with their owne Tenets.

What one act or duty ſavouring of ſincerity or the power of Chriſt, is not catcht at, curtolled, diminiſhed, and diſpenſed with?<note place="margin">Diſpenſations againſt the power of truths, is a great ſinne of our times.</note> When were the laſcivious wits of men more buſied, or their prophane hearts more bold, in fleecing away the extents of the truths of God, as they are in Jeſus?

Who ever heard that ignorance bred cloſeneſſe, or that light bred liberty? True it is, that as truth, ſo the power of truth lies low in the earth, and is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den deep, and requires a long time to dig it out. But to affirme that the truth was more ſtrict in the beginning of time, then after; and that it is the honour of time to broach liberty &amp; looſneſſe, how unreaſonable it is? No, rather we have by our baſe deſerting of truth, or detaining the ſame in unrighteouſneſſe, brought upon our ſelves a revolt from both truth and the power thereof in great meaſure, and made our ends worſe then our beginnings; except the Lord mercifully doe ſet our Sunne ten degrees back, and reduce us againe to our firſt temper. Let us not think thoſe dayes which God honoured with ſo much blood of our Martyrs, (and that in the infancy of our Church) were further off the power and ſavour of godlineſſe, then we are. Rather it might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us even now (in our Laodicean ſelf-ſufficiency) to learn of them, and not to pretend our own liberty and breadth, as an argument of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perfection.</p>

Who ſhould ſo poorly know his owne ſpirit in this kinde (if he attend it at all) but this work ſhould be pretious? Either to rid his ſoule of her baſe ſlightneſſe, or to faſten upon it, the cords and chaines of God with more cloſeneſſe and delight: Say thus to the Lord, Oh I feel no power, no girding of loines,<note place="margin">A forme of ſuch a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</note> no awe, nor feare to lye upon my ſoule by thy commands; I ſit looſe to prayer, to watching, to hearing, to meditation: I feele this day ſlipt from me, without redeeming it to the beſt uſe, in all my ſolitarineſſe, company, liberties, duties, I have been as one in a dead ſleep; no vertue hath gone out of me this day, either of living by faith in the promiſes, or of compaſſion to the diſtreſſed, of love to the Saints, mourning for the afflictions of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> I have met with objects of the world, of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, of uncharitableneſſe, and yet no chaines of thine have been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſpirit, but I have walked as one at his owne tearms: Surely the cords of Gods Law have not bound my luſts as a ſacrifice to his altar, nor the loadſtone of his love hath not ſweetly drawne my ſoule to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him with delight, but I have beene mine owne man in all theſe! My will hath not beene ſubject, and (as it were) bound up in thine.<note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> I have not beene my ſelfe under thy authority, as that Centurion was! I looke that my will ſhould bee done by all that are under me, yea I looke that they ſhould walke in all wel-pleaſing toward a ſinfull wretch, yea, obey me punctually, cloſely, univerſally, yea, my very thoughts, that he might be a ſervant according to mine owne heart, and whether I give a reaſon or no of my charges, I thinke it equall, that my inferiour doe nothing at all ſwerve from my commands.</p>

O Lord, I deceive all that know me, when I doe the materiall part of a command, the life of the duty is abſent; when I doe the morall part, the ſpirituall is far off; and although I ſee and know it thus, I am ſo chained under the law of my corruptions, that the integrity, the ſcope, the fruitfulneſſe, the large-heartedneſſe of my obedience, is not to be ſeene: Oh! I offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices halt and blinde, wanting heart, liver and reignes: I am ſo fraut with my ſelfe,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note> and the command of evill, that good is ſeldome preſent. A luſt hath a principle in me, cauſing mee to love it, to ſerve it, to uſe all means to fulfill it, to ſhunne ſtudiouſly whatſoever might croſſe it: But I feele not that ſpirit of grace, which ſhould cauſe me to obey, from a principle of ſweetnes: ſtill there is ſomewhat which me thinks I chuſe rather to doe, and to be ſwaied by, then the law of love to God for his love to my ſoule! Oh! herein the Lord my God be mercifull to mee, that wheras I have found as much mercy as any, yet I have bowed to this luſt, and that, and worſhip my owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and am as like to do ſtill, if the awe of God lie not more cloſely upon my ſoule! Oh! that this fire might alway ſo burne upon mine altar, as might conſume my droſſe, and put ſome life and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage into into mee, to get out of this Circle in which the Devill hath conjured mee, to walke deadly and baſely towards the Commands of God!</p>
               <p>Nay (which is worſe) O Lord, I am growne to this point, even to lie as a beaſt in a ſlow, groning under her burden: ſo lie I, in a fullen diſcontent of heart at the Lord himſelfe, that he enlarges mee no better, when as yet I nouriſh my ſelfe, all the while, in my eaſe, and carnall diſtaſte of his ſtreight Commands! Oh! me thinks my curſed heart (becauſe it cannot have her will of him) could even tell him to his face, That he is an hard Maſter, and gathers where he ſtrawed not! Alas! I conſider not, that he hath mee at the vantage, becauſe I have loſt the grace of my creation; nay abuſed a better grace of Mercy; and therfore may juſtly be puniſht for the leaſt Rebellion. And not only thus, but from this ſtubborne heart of mine, it comes, that I ſet my ſayles abroad, and commit my ſelfe to winde, and weather: am not ſmitten when I breake all cords in two, as <hi>Samſon</hi> I am looſe in Sabbaths, in the curbing of my paſſions, my vaine thoughts have their through-fare, and lodge in mee, and yet I am not troubled, I ſwallow every gobbet, and let it go: Once I could ſtraine at a gnat, but now I devoure Camels, and heare no more of them: Oh! Lord, I picke quarrels with thoſe lawes, which have formerly been equall to mee!</p>
               <p>And (more then theſe; Lord) I am growne to this ſad point, that the ſence of a bit and bridle, is (by cuſtome of looſenes) quite ſlipt out of my mouth; I begin to frame God, to be ſuch an one, as my baſe heart could be content he were: even a God like to my ſelfe, who will neither do good,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> nor evill: whoſe threats are as the clappes of thunder, without any ſtroke following: I hope to go on in a Round and way of

               <p>In all theſe reſpects, what ſhall a poore ſoule (O Lord) do,<note place="margin">Concluſion of this branch.</note> with it ſelfe? What (O my deer God) ſhall bring me back againe, after all theſe deſperate revolts, unto thee? I wonder that I ſhould not be wholy left, to utter woe and open offences! I know nothing in my ſelfe, why Satan ſhould not have mee at ſuch a bay, as to cauſe me to depart from God, groſſely, and generally, aſwell as in theſe ſecret rebellions! For, I waxe weary of thy yoke, and am content that others ſhould abide the heate of thy worke, and my ſelfe be releaſed! O Lord, I am ſo farre from pleaſing my ſelfe in this ſtate, that, rather then I would be under the miſery of my ſlightneſſe, I could wiſh thou woldſt caſt ſome other unpleaſing chaines upon mee; ſome ſtinging croſſe, ſome corraſive to eate out my dead fleſh: And, (as untoward as I am to ſuffer) if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not my ſelfe, I could wiſh the ſweet fruit or ſuch a courſe, with ſome pinch to my fleſh, rather then thus giddily to provoke thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty by the tranſgreſſion of thy Commands!</p>
               <p>But thirdly and above all, this is exhortation to all Gods people, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>3</label> to ſadden their hearts, and to lie under the Authority of Commands for Conſcience ſake. A moſt ſollemne point, above all, that I can ſay to urgeit. As before I ſpake, when <hi>Iacob</hi> went to Luz God caſt a feare upon the nations, that they durſt not ſtirre a joint againſt him. Oh!<note place="margin">Geneſ. 35.5.</note> ſuch a feare ſhouldſt thou beſeech God, to caſt upon thy ſoule in ſecret,<note place="margin">Feare of God beſetting the heart a great meane to keep cloſe to God.</note> whereſoever thou becommeſt, that it may hem in and compell thee to obey! As its ſayd of the clowd which filled the Temple, and cauſed the people to feare the preſence of God, who was in the midſt therof: ſo, ſhould this cloud alway lie upon thy ſoule, to ſmite an awe into thy ſoule of offending. Theris is a baſe ſpirit in us: it is not love alone, which can long hold us within bonds:<note place="margin">Heb. 12. end.</note> Therfore we had need (as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. end) to hold faſt ſuch grace, as may cauſe us to walke in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and holy feare.<note place="margin">Deut. 32.46.</note> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> (ſumming up the contents of that Swans ſong of his, in two words) tells the people: Set your hearts to all the words of this booke, which I teſtifie to you this day, that is the law of the covenant: its a ſadde law: ſadly therfore ſet your hearts to it. He, whom wee have to do with, is one,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.13.</note> to whom all things are open and manifeſt: his word is quicke and as a two edged ſpirit, dividing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſoule and ſpirit, the joints and marrow, the thoughts and intents of the heart. Dally not therfore with him: Its fearfull to fall into his hands: He will not ſpare us: but will puniſh our ſins. And,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.31.</note> if we call him father, who judgeth without reſpect of perſons:<note place="margin">1.

               <p>In ſpeciall,<note place="margin">The command of the Goſpell to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt is moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is the moſt ſoveraigne and indiſpenſable of all other: Obey this, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey all: for in this ſtands the obedience to all the reſt. The Lord hath ingaged all his glory and honour upon this one: That the moſt vile,
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:45715:300"/> miſerable ſinner living, who is willing to come in with his load pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to hell, ſhall finde eaſe: Whether it ſeeme ſo, or no, this is the truth, he hath purpoſed to magnifie all his Attributes in ſhewing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to ſuch an one: He will have it knowne, that he can doe that which fleſh cannot, even love the moſt hatefull enemy in the world, that is weary of his enmity. This he hath ſet down with himſelfe from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; in time hath declared it to his Church, by giving his juſtice a full diſcharge in the blood of his Sonne. Hee is the upſhot of promiſes, and therfore looks that he be beleeved; yea, for a recompence hereof, that he hath made all <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> in him,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.20. Joh. 3.33.</note> he deſires but to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, counting them that doe ſo, to ſeale that he is true: and calling the reſt lyers. Conſult not now with fleſh and reaſon; Say not, that this word is farre from thee,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.8.</note> it is neere thee, it is offered and pin'd to thy ſleeve,<note place="margin">Eſay 1. Luke 5.7.</note> that thou mightſt beleeve it; conſent and obey this, and the worſt is paſt. As <hi>Peter</hi> ſayd to Chriſt, At thy command I will caſt in, though I have caſt all night, and catcht nothing: So ſay thou, I have long traded with mine owne inventions, devotions and duties, but now at thy command, I will try what thy promiſe is worth, and caſt my ſelfe wholly upon it for pardon, grace and life. If I periſh, I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. Venture ſo and proſper. Secondly, proceed to other commands: The ſame Lord of commands, bids us love one another; for love ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filleth the Law,<note place="margin">Joh. 14. Jam. 3. 1 Tim. 1. All other commands iſſue from faith.</note> the end thereof being love out of a pure and good conſcience, and love unfained. Feare this command alſo. The perſon of man (who is thy immediate object of love) may, perhaps, ſeeme contemptible to thee; for what can he doe unto thee, whether thou love or love not? But he that made thee and him too, and hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you both in the body of his Church, under Chriſt the head; he it is, who bids thee love thy neighbour; love him by reproofe, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him not; love him by counſell, example, admonition, compaſſion: lowre not upon him, curb ſelfe-love, paſſion, indignation, wrath, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, revenge, ſlighting of him, diſdaining him: Thinke with thy ſelfe, it is not for nought that all the commands are ſaid to bee done in this one, of Love: Thinke not that all ſhall be well if thou canſt but beleeve in Chriſt;<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> know, that the Lord Jeſus himſelfe, who will call for faith at his comming, Luke 18.8. will call for love alſo. The want of love, and the due carriage of thy heart toward others, is a ſpirituall ſolemne command of the Goſpel as well as faith, and one day will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be ſo: when God ſhall call thee to the Barre, and convince thee, how little fruit of love hath ever proceeded from thee. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cloſe with this charge alſo; look not upon man, but upon that God who hath bound thee to him by this chain of love, and who will hold himſelfe wronged in the violation of it: lay a more ſolemne charge upon thy ſpirit in this kinde, then ever, and feele thy ſoule to lye under the authority of this command, as well as the former.</p>
               <p>And what more ſhould I ſay? From theſe two well-ſprings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all the ſtreames of Commands, concerning, God, Man, and thy ſelfe. Hence iſſueth a Command of a cloſe keeping the Sabbath, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering thy converſation aright;<note place="margin">Eph. 5.15. Jam. 1. ult.</note> hence comes that charge of walking circumſpectly, as wiſe: keeping thy ſelfe unſpotted of the world. Hence
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:45715:300"/> it is, that thou art forbidden to have thy courſe in covetouſneſſe, to have any fellowſhip with the unfruitfull workes of darkneſſe. Hence alſo it is, that thou art bidden, Redeeme the ſeaſon;<note place="margin">Heb. 13.5. Eph. 5.11.16. Mat. 16.26. 1 Pet. 3.9.</note> Walke wiſely toward them who are without: To take up thy croſſe daily, to deny thy ſelfe, to live by faith to ſanctifie God in thine heart, and make him thy feare. And the like I might ſay of the reſt (for it were endleſſe to ſpeake of all.) Conceive of them all as comming from one rule of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: And know it, hee that requires one, urges all: Perhaps thou wouldſt thinke it equall to obey the Magiſtrate, obey thy Parents, keep the Sabbath: but know it, the ſame God commands thee to preach in ſeaſon and our, to execute the righteous judgements of God, to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to thy husband, to teach thy children the feare of God: Theſe are ſpeciall ones, and leſſe welcome; but if thou obey not them, thou doeſt but play faſt and looſe with God in the generals: For all ſound obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God is equall and uniforme. I know what fleſh will ſay, Tis tedious to be ſo tied and tasked, to be held to it from day to day, never out: ſay not, I could be content to faſt and pray one day, to redeeme liberty for many: I could walk cloſe for a Sabbath, ſo I might be mine owne man all the weeke. But know, that the law of love takes no thought for continuance; it is no violent compulſion, as a ſlave to ply his worke; but as naturall as for the fire to burne, or the ſparkes to flye upward. Let the Law bee once written in thy heart,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.31.</note> and it will teach thee holy wiſedome, love and delight to accommodate and apt thy ſelfe to each one in ſpeciall equally and conſtantly.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> The Law and Art of muſick in the minde, acts the fingers ends to ſuch a nimbleneſſe and preſentneſſe of ſervice, as is admirable. And if the writing of letters and characters upon Fringes and Frontlets, were ſo powerfull, as to prompt a man to the obedience of each occaſion: what then is the law of grace written in each faculty of the minde and will, in the reines and the ſpirit of the Soule? But here I ceaſe for this time. Let us pray, &amp;c.</p>

                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting to obey. 1. Faith.</note> The firſt and one mayne is, get the Lord Jeſus to be thy lawgiver. <hi>Moſes</hi> is a commander of rigorous, impoſſible duties, ſerving rather to convince the ſoule of that power of created righteouſnes, which we have loſt; then to enable us to obey. But the Lord Ieſus, is a more mild and mercifull lawgiver: who as he hath united God with fleſh, in his owne perſon: ſo therein he hath broken downe that wall, which ſtood up, as a Tower impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 1.20. Eph. 3.15.16.</note> between God and us: he hath made all levell and eaſie, and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the hand-writings of Morals and Ceremonials, unto his Croſſe, that it might never appeare againſt us. Nay more, hee hath fulfilled all righteouſneſſe both of doing and ſuffering, that wee in him might be clothed with it as a Robe from top to toe, and might fulfill the Law by faith.<note place="margin">Practic. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tech. part. 3. Art. 5.</note> I have at large opened this point elſewhere in the doctrine of it: Let us here urge the neceſſity of faith upon our ſelves, and cloſe with the promiſe, to make it our owne. The truth is, there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, but Chriſt hath made it poſſible and ſweet, and by a promiſe he conveyes it to the ſoule, ſaying; Take my yoke upon you, for is eaſie;<note place="margin">Mat. 11.29.</note> and my burden, for it is light. Of our ſelves wee have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Law in our members, leading us captives thereto: a law of luſt,
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:45715:301"/> pride, ambition, ſloth, prophaneneſſe, hypocriſie, and ſelfe-love. Theſe naturally we take thought to fulfill, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Rom. 13. <hi>ult.</hi> But the Lord Jeſus hath deſtroyed this power in us of ſin and death,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.2. Rom. 13. ult.</note> eaſed us of the impoſſibleneſſe of obeying through the weakneſſe of our fleſh. He hath quit us of being debtors to our fleſh, to fulfill it, and redeemed us to himſelfe. Nothing remaines now, ſave that wee put on the Lord Jeſus by faith, that wee renounce our old baſe bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and ſlavery, that we be willing to be free-men, and that we cloſe with the promiſe of ſweet obedience, by our beleeving it. For this was his ſcope in eaſing us of one burden, to put upon us another; yet eaſie and ſweet. Let this then be the firſt Rule: If thou wouldeſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law, beleeve. Faith hath united all the elect to Chriſt his Fleſh and God-head, who fulfilled all righteouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.4.</note> and was made under the Law, that he might be the end of the Law to righteouſneſſe for all that beleeve. Faſten then upon this, That the Lord Jeſus never brake one Law, performed all; never preacht Sermon leſſe then hee was bound to, never did one miracle leſſe then hee ought, failed in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ground, ſubſtance, manner, meaſure, end of obeying; but did all in perfection: And none of this he did for himſelfe (ſure I am, not properly and purpoſely) but for us, wee were his ſcope: for our ſakes he did all. And why? Surely, that we might partake it, not onely in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from guilt and wrath; but alſo in acceptation with God, as his beloved, and his righteous ſervants, prepared for every good worke. As the Lord offered us Chriſt to the former end; ſo doth hee for this latter: he is as faithfull in the one, as the other: Therefore,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5.24. Rom. 12.2. Coloſſ. 1.10. Philip. 4.</note> ſunder wee not thoſe things which God hath joyned together: but put wee on Chriſt in both, to redeeme us from guilt, and to make us Prieſts and Kings, to offer up ſacrifices of all well pleaſing and obedience, with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delight and cheerfulneſſe. He is faithfull that hath promiſed, who alſo will doe it. He who hath him, for his owne, who hath done and ſuffered all: hee, whoſe Chriſt is by imputation of righteouſneſſe, and by not imputation of ſinne, ſinneth not, fulfilleth the Law, and is that which he is unto whom he is united by faith. This for the firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if thou wouldeſt obey commands cloſely,<note place="margin">2. Meditation of the object.</note> then muſe ſeriouſly of the ſadneſſe and ſolemneſſe thereof, and incorporate thy ſoule into it. Firſt, muſe of the ſpiritualneſſe of them. If Gods Candle ſearch the bowels of the belly, and pierce the ſoule; bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in thy meditations, that the baſeneſſe of thy hollow, vaine, worldly wandring heart upon the Sabboth, vexes the Spirit of God, as much as working or playing: and ſo in other duties. Secondly, of the univerſality of them: Muſe therefore of this; It is not my wealth or poverty, my greatneſſe or meanneſſe, my learning or ignorance, which can diſpenſe with me; with God there is no reſpect of perſons: No time, no place, no circumſtances can preſcribe againſt God; he is one and the ſame object of feare in all places, duties, times, occaſions. Thirdly, muſe of the indiſpenſableneſſe of Gods Commands. Courts may diſpenſe with mens offences: Gods penalties cannot be bought off nor commuted. Gods commands are unappealable, comming from the higheſt Court of heaven: Lower Courts cannot be appealed unto
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:45715:302"/> from the higher. Fourthly, they are his Commands, who is infinite in wiſdome, righteouſneſſe and vengeance, ſees, knowes and tries all obedience, is preſent every where, and ſtrong enough to puniſh the breaches of any one; no man can avoid his eye, or eſcape his cenſure; He backs all Commands with threats, and purſues threats with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges.

                  </gap>fthly, they are abſolute: no colours, no diſtinctions will be admitted; they are ſubject to no mans interpretation, but to their owne: They are both Text and Comment to themſelves. Other mens charges and ſtatutes are yet ſubject to conſtruction, and interpretation, ſo oft as any ambiguous queſtions fall out about them, and by that means are often perverted quite and cleane from their ſincere intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But no Divell, hereticke, or prophane perſon, could ever remove Gods limits, or overthrow his meanings: As they were, ſo they ſtill abide.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. ult.</note> The word of God abideth for ever. Such thoughts as theſe being ſetled by meditation upon the ſoule, may be as powerfull to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade cloſeneſſe in obeying, as the thoughts of bad men upon the wrongs offered them, provoke them to revenge. If the Lord goe with the one, as Satan goes with the other, they muſt needs proſper. Righteous (O Lord) are all thy judgemens, therefore thy ſervant fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thee.</p>

Pſal. 119.4.</note>Thirdly, its excellent for us to turn our eyes off from all ſlighters and paltrers with God, abhorring their declinings, Pſal. 101. But to bend the eye of the ſoule towards them that are ſingular in grace, and cloſe obeying. So <hi>David</hi> tells us, That he ſet ſuch before his eyes, till hee was raviſht with them: Doubtleſſe (ſaith he) they goe not aſtray from any commands: As if he ſhould ſay, oh that I were ſuch an one! With the baſe and formall, a man ſhould ſoon learne that trade: But the watchfull, the wakefull, the cloſe, the conſcionable, will ſoone teach us their practiſe; ſo that it will be a ſhame unto us to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and it will fixe the naile of commands deep into our hearts as with an hammer.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. ult.</note>

Pſal. 119.27.</note>The fourth is Prayer, which is the conſtant helpe which Gods people have alway uſed to eaſe themſelves by at this pinch. <hi>David</hi> prayes God to teach him his Law graciouſly: marke, graciouſly, that is, in the ſweetneſſe, eaſe, delight, and reward of it, not in the toile and difficulty thereof.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> So againe, Oh that mine heart were directed to keepe thy commands! They that feele the true weight of them, will groane under their owne weakneſſe, and pray for ſtrength! Hence that holy prayer of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> Give ſtrength to doe what thou bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, and bid what thou wilt! Turne all Gods promiſes and covenants into prayers; for there is no one command urged upon the ſoule, but it hath a promiſe annexed. Oh Lord, thou haſt ſaid thou wilt encline me to keep thy Law, Thou haſt promiſed to write it and engrave it in my fleſhly tables, to cauſe me to walke in all thy Statutes! Oh doe it Lord! Open mine eyes, that I may ſee the wonders of thy Lawes, their perfection and excellency, &amp; then take the ſtone out of my heart, and make it tender, they may pierce into it, with feare and awe: Helpe Lord, my fruit is come to the birth, and there is no ſtrength to bring forth.</p>
               <pb n="565" facs="tcp:45715:302"/>
               <p>Fifthly, get humbleneſſe of ſpirit, and that will equall Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. Murmure not, fret not at the cloſeneſſe of them, for that ſatisfies not God: But be as a worme before him,<note place="margin">The fifth rule, Humility.</note> and tremble at his voice, as we ſee the poore wormes come ſhaking and trembling out of the earth when they feele the feet of any treading the earth. <hi>Eſay</hi> hath this ſpeech in one place, You have made me to ſerve by your rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. A proud heart makes God ſerve baſe fleſh. An humble heart which knowes it ſelfe, ſerves God, and is glad that it may be accepted. In Pſal. 2.12. we ſee how baſe men take upon them: But whence is it? Oh, pride makes them caſt away all the cords of God from them! Pride makes them to ſay, Our tongues are our owne, what Lord ſhall controll us? A ſwelling proud heart will not endure any pinch of Law more then it ſelfe likes. But the humble wil take Law at Gods hands gladly, and concurre with him: Haſt thou (O Lord) bidden me deny my ſelfe? Abſtaine from fleſhly luſts? Poſſeſſe my ſoule with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? my veſſell in holineſſe and honour? Its juſt Lord, thy will is a rule, I deſire not to ſee beyond it: Proud ſervants love a faire Livery, and great wages, better then cloſe commands: But the humble will take any worke upon them, and ſay, its their object. Beware then of a ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, queazy, coy and proud heart.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, marke cloſely the threats of God againſt each rebellion:<note place="margin">The ſixt rule. Obſerve Gods Judgments.</note> and the verifying thereof in experience, both in Scripture and daily. This will cut the combe of preſumption! For who have offended God and proſpered? Its a maxime: lot upon it, whether thou ſee it ſo or not, be ſure it will be ſo: As that old Prophet told his ſonnes,<note place="margin">1 Kings 13.</note> Bury me in the grave of the man of God; for all which hee hath ſaid againſt this place, ſhall ſurely come to paſſe. To get a weighty heart under threats (giving them a being in the ſoule, through faith) is the onely way for Commands to take effect: For God hath fortified the one with the other; if the fence be broken down, the corne lieth open to the ſtroyance of all beaſts. Obſerve cloſely, how God plagues drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, ſwearers, adulterers, Sunday breakers, and the like; and adde the patternes of the Scripture (oft preſſed by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iude</hi>) that wee may not thinke their damnation ſleepes: elſe we will bee Atheiſts,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. Epiſt. Jude. Pſal. 50.</note> and frame God like our ſelves. But this will awe us: Such and ſuch ventured ſo and ſo, but they paid ſweetly for it; if we be content to ſhare with them, wee may ſide with them, but not elſe. For Gods wrath will not rot in the sky.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.</note> Deferring of judgement ſets the heart of a ſinner, yea hardens it to rebellion; but beleeving it workes feare and prevention, as in <hi>Noah,</hi> Heb. 11.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note>

               <p>Seventhly, deny thy ſelfe.<note place="margin">The ſeventh rule. Selfe-deniall.</note> Selfe and God will runne in a ſtream a while, as filthy dung, and pure apples in a river, till the one be ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the other. So our own ends and Gods make a poor ſhift to go together a while till trouble and loſſes, reproach and purſuit divide them, but then they ſever. Sure it is, That man who hath no other o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience for God, ſave that which will goe in his owne ſtreame, of eaſe, ſafety, content, quiet and welfare, will abandon God, when he is tried: Therefore he that meanes to walk cloſely with God, let him ſhake off ſuch weights as theſe. The like I may ſay of ſuch,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> as dare
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:45715:303"/> adventure to ſuffer in Gods cauſe, upon hope to lick themſelves whole by carnall ſupplies. No, no: All ſuch build upon the ſands of their owne falſe hopes, the Lord will ſcatter them. I deny not, but that God is all-ſufficient to all his, and hath promiſed not to faile them; yea, to give them an hundred fold requitall. But this is to them that walke uprightly,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.</note> Gen. 17.1. not to hirelings who obtrude their ſervice, and know no requitals but carnall: Such, it is juſt with God to leave to their owne ſhifts;<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note> even to cry a confederacy, to feare the feares of the wicked, and to put forth their hand unto evill, becauſe of their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: They will buy out the aire of a priſon, but their owne aire ſhall choke them; onely they who can truſt God in his promiſe, and are content to take his pay in good worth, what ever it bee, ſuch God will not forſake: And ſuch onely are meet perſons to obey, becauſe they are armed.</p>

                  <note place="margin">8. Rewards.</note>Laſtly, digeſt truly the reward of cloſe obeying, not onely in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when it ſhall be knowne to men and Angels, who they are (though unknowne to the world:) But even here alas! Gods peoples right hand knowes not what their left hand doth: They acknowledge little to come from them,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> they keep all to themſelves. When did wee ſee thee naked and clothed thee? Hungry, and fed thee? Sicke, and in priſon, and viſited thee? Why are you ſuch ſtrangers to your owne duties? Then ſhall others be ſtrangers to your joy: onely your ſelves ſhall enjoy the priviledge of your own cloſe walking: For be yee ſure, God will not conceale it; cloſe love ſhall never want cloſe peace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne welfare, and comfort of heart, proſperity in grace, growth and experience. You that walke in the regeneration of obedience with Chriſt, ſhall not only ſit upon Thrones hereafter in ſtead of your duſt and aſhes here: But in the meane while you ſhall fare as Chriſt fared; he who made it his meat and drinke to doe his Fathers will, had meat to eate which no man knew of:<note place="margin">Joh. 4.</note> Nouriſh thou a mourning heart for ſinne, thine owne and others, a cloſe heart to obey, and no man ſhall bee able to judge what thy joyes are:<note place="margin">Prov. 10.29.</note> Thy worke is alſo thy wages, and yet the Lord ſhall beſides ſupport thee otherwiſe; ſo that neither ſpirituall nor earthly requitals ſhall bee wanting, till at laſt that life of thine which was hid with Chriſt in God,<note place="margin">Col. 3.3.</note> ſhall breake out before all, Men and Angels. Then ſhall cloſe obedience bee ſwallowed up into exceeding glory; and the garments of joy ſhall bee added to thy ſecret conſolations, in the day wherein Chriſt himſelfe ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in glory.

Touching the ground of this point out of the Text, it needs not many words to be ſpent about it. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that the obedience of <hi>Naaman</hi> in going to waſh, proceeded from no heat of ſudden alteration of minde, no pang or humour, no blinde hope, or had-I-wiſt, as who ſay, It's but trying, I will goe, hit I or miſſe I, it is but my journey. No, but as he was ſtrongly held back before, by a deep ſelfe-conceit; ſo now hee is drawne forward by as deep an inſpiration of God, and a perſwaſion that the promiſe annexed to his waſhing, was as certaine and undeceiveable, as the charge was divine and abſolute: and therefore in obeying God commanding, hee conſents to God promiſing alſo, in as full and abſolute a degree, and in all points and reſpects as the promiſe lay: that is to ſay, not that hee ſhould perhaps be cured, perhaps not; but that the cure ſhould bee whole and entire, no manner of Leproſie ſhould hereafter cleave to him any more, but as now he was naſty and ſcurvie all over, ſo then he ſhould be healed by the healing of God, (better then if <hi>Eliſha</hi> had laid his hand upon it) that is, as perfectly as if hee never had been Leper, and his fleſh ſhould returne to him as the fleſh of a little childe, ſo clean ſhould he become, and return home, and not repent him that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved the promiſe in the fulneſſe thereof. So much for the ground of the Text.</p>
               <p>Now (as I noted in the former point) here ſome may ſtep in and object, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> Why doe you ground a doctrine upon ſuch a paſſage as this of <hi>Naaman?</hi> Alas! his waſhing was but an outward act, and that occaſionall and perſonall, onely reaching to himſelfe, and determining with him: Our caſe is otherwiſe, and it muſt be a bottome of eternall truth, which muſt ground a doctrine of this nature, becauſe it concerns the perpetuall practice of a poore ſoule in reſpect of pardon and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</p>

                  </label> what the particular of this promiſe to <hi>Naaman</hi> is, or is not: but what the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of every promiſe requires, whether it bee occaſionall and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or ſpirituall and generall. The point is this, Every promiſe, bee it what it will be, whether for once and away, or for adoe, being from God, requires an equall obedience and extent of faith to embrace it, and caſt the ſoule upon it, as well as the moraleſt and generalleſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the Word can doe. The reaſon is plaine, becauſe in the one,
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:45715:304"/> as well as the other, is encloſed that power and truth of God, which bindes the ſoule to an equall and uniforme obedience. I ſpeake now (and marke well) of ſuch promiſes as require our faith for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; for ſome promiſes are abſolute in themſelves, and reſt upon the naked word, whether we beleeve them or not, becauſe they be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall:<note place="margin">Gen. 8.21.</note> As that the rainebow ſhall be a ſure ſigne of no more deluges: That ſeaſons of the yeare, Summer and Winter, ſowing time and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, ſhall continue: That the Goſpell ſhall bee preached to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:<note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe promiſes though they deſerve credit, yet ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed howſoever, being pitcht and appointed by God in their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But for perſonall promiſes not ſo: That particular promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> touching a ſonne (if yet it were particular) or any other concerning a preſent mercy or deliverance,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.10.

Hence it is, that uſually Chriſt effected no particular miracle, but he required faith to beleeve it to the full: If thou beleeveſt nothing is impoſſible: Did not I ſay to thee, If thou canſt beleeve <hi>(Martha)</hi> thou ſhouldeſt ſee the power of God?<note place="margin">John 11.40.</note> So that <hi>Naaman</hi> here in the promiſe of healing, was tyed to a punctuall cloſing, and caſting himſelfe upon the promiſe, as well as we are in the more ſpiritual and generall. And in this reſpect, this Text is a ſure ground of Doctrine to us, becauſe, if, even promiſes onely for preſent uſe, and of leſſe importance, required ſuch faith, much more doe thoſe require it which are of perpetuall nature, and far greater conſequence. And ſo much ſhall ſerve to anſwer the doubt.</p>
               <p>Now I proceed to Proofes, and ſo to the clearing of the truth by reaſon, and anſwer of ſome queſtions, and ſo to Uſe: For the Proofes, firſt take that place, Eph. 4 21. If ye have learned and knowne the Truth as it is in Jeſus. Marke how the holy Ghoſt prevents the carnall miſtake of Promiſes: They muſt not be taken up as our wit ſerves, or to make up our own ends; but as they lye in the way and ſcope of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as the truth is in Jeſus. This is a myſtery to a lazy, carnall, baſe heart, which conſtrues promiſes (as men that interpret Statutes) to their owne eaſe and ends: No, Jeſus his truths will not ſubmit to us, but we muſt come to them, and beleeve as the truth is in Jeſus. What that is, ſhall appeare after. Another Text may be that in Rom. 12. the laſt: But, Put ye on the Lord Jeſus, &amp;c. He compares the Promiſe, and Chriſt to apparrell (as well he may both for warmth and ornament) and faith to the putting on of our apparrell. Now we know apparrell be it never ſo fit, yet if it be put on wrong, it will neither warme nor become the body: If that which ſhould cloath the legs or feet, ſhould be applied to the head, if that which ſhould bee put on the hippes or thighs, be put upon the ſhoulders, what an uſeleſſe and prepoſterous cloathing will it prove? Even ſo, if the promiſes of God be miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and miſ-put on, they will doe us no pleaſure, our worke will prove but unprofitable,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.11.</note> and ridiculous.

<pb n="569" facs="tcp:45715:304"/> ſpeakes of the due preaching of the promiſes, and the whole word, may be applied to our hearing and beleeving them: <hi>viz.</hi> That wee preach the words of God, as the words, and ſo we muſt beleeve them, even as they lye, and as they are, without our mixtures, qualifyings, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, ſtretchings or ſtraitnings: We muſt take the promiſes as God offers them: God made a promiſe to <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 27. That he would give him all the ſoules that were with him in the Ship. <hi>Paul</hi> beleeved God, but how? Surely, that all in the Ship ſhould abide therein; ſo that when ſome would have gone out, <hi>Paul</hi> boldy tels them, That except they abode in the Ship, they could not be ſafe. Why? Becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe muſt be beleeved as it imported, and not as it was conſtrued by them: <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood the contents of it, and therefore told them, the promiſe was no promiſe, except it were taken according to it, to the purpoſe and meaning of God in it. God bids <hi>Noah</hi> build an Arke, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing ſafety by it: How doth <hi>Noah</hi> goe to worke?<note place="margin">Gen. 6.14.</note> Doth hee build an Arke at his owne pleaſure? Doth hee make it of what forme and ſcantling he liſts? Doth he pitch it within and not without? No, he conſtrues the promiſe of ſafety in the Arke according to it, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the promiſe was, I will ſave thee by mine Arke, but I will have it ſuch an one as I appoint, elſe I will not ſave thee by it. Juſt ſo doth the Lord to us: He will ſave us by his Promiſe, by his Word, Baptiſme: But hee will have both beleeved according to that which himſelfe hath put in them, and not according to any carnall, Popiſh or ſelf-ſenſe of our own. There was a promiſe of protection to Iſrael by the pillar of cloud, and by the pillar of fire by day and by night: But how?<note place="margin">Num. 10.34.</note> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaning of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That they muſt watch cloſely both the ſtanding ſtill or the removing of them both: They durſt not goe on, when they ſtood ſtill, nor pitch when they removed: And ſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of conduct, being aright taken, became moſt uſefull to them: It was the promiſe of God to heare his peoples prayers in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but they who praied were to pray according to it, that is, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king toward the Temple, though they were never ſo far off, as <hi>Ionah</hi> in the whales belly, <hi>Daniel</hi> in Captivity. See alſo <hi>David</hi> Pſ. 27.2. I have called upon thee, looking towards thine Oracle, meaning the Holy of Holies, the beſt part of it, becauſe there ſtood the Arke of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and the Mercy-ſeat upon it. To conclude, the ſumme of all is, Gods promiſes muſt be beleeved according to all that God offers the ſoule in them, neither more nor leſſe.</p>
               <p>But now, ere we proceed to Uſe, a queſtion here offers it ſelfe: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> What meane you by this phraſe, According to a promiſe? And in what particulars doth it conſiſt? For anſwer whereto, this I ſay, that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> it conſiſts in two things: Firſt,<note place="margin">Accordance of a promiſe ſtands in two things.</note> in the due qualification of perſons to the promiſes. Secondly, in the due accordance of promiſes to perſons. For the firſt, as all may not medle with each promiſe, ſo ſome may medle with none at all. Promiſes and they, warpe, accord not. For why? They are unqualified for them, and that may be in two regards: The each more groſſe, the other more narrow. Touching the former, know this, Not one prophane companion, who can boaſt and ſay, I have got a promiſe, may apply a promiſe, for a promiſe muſt alſo get
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:45715:305"/> thee. There is no peace to the wicked, and therefore no promiſe: We apply no ſalves, no bands to a bleeding wound: For why? The bloud would beare it off,<note place="margin">1. In accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</note> and marre it as faſt as its laid on. Thou haſt no ſenſe or need of any promiſe, for that belongs onely to ſuch as want. The Law and the reward of doers belongs to thee; no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, at leaſt not of the Goſpell. In this caſe, beleeving is like to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying. Not each party is a meet one for every wife or husband, but thoſe who are apt each for other. Who laughs not at a Scullion, or Cooke,<note place="margin">All ſorts may not beleeve promiſes.</note> or houſe-keeper, that burnes in love with the Lady or miſtreſſe of the houſe? Or at a Student, or Preacher, whom none but a great woman of nobility or honour will ſerve? Or at ſome young youth who marries a woman of threeſcore? Alas! they are miſmatcht, all ſee and ſay, money and wealth, or prepoſterous love for their owne ends, not for the due ends of marriage love, made ſuch matches. No, apt and meet ones may marry, they onely are beyond exception. So is it here: Not every one who is without a promiſe, may preſently mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it, not each baſe fellow ſteaming and ſweating out of the Alehouſe or Stewes: Such little look at a promiſe as a promiſe for the honour of grace, but at their owne ends, to gull themſelves with falſe hopes. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith well, Pſal. 119. Thy promiſe, O Lord, wherein thou haſt cauſed thy ſervant to truſt. But God cauſeth not every one to beleeve a promiſe, but forbids them as preſumptuous; yea though they dare ſay that though there were but three ſaved, they ſhould be one: and againe, what a foole art thou, that canſt not beleeve? I would beleeve I trow, or elſe its pitty but thou ſhouldeſt periſh! Oh thou foole, even of thine owne mouth!</p>

But ſecondly, a promiſe is excluſive, as well of ſuch as are in fairer way of beleeving, and that is of all ſuch as will bring of their owne coſt towards beleefe and ſalvation. Oh thou couſeneſt thy ſelfe, not knowing a promiſe: for a promiſe is ſuch a way of God, as craves the onely reliance of an empty deſolate ſoule upon it ſelfe: Thats the nature of it: its a royall thing, can endure no peere or part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. So much of this.</p>

                  <note place="margin">2. In the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to them in ſundry par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</note>The ſecond accordance of a promiſe, ſtands in the qualifying of it to the perſon who may and doth beleeve it: or if you will in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall beneficialnes of a promiſe to the ſoul: and this more directly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the point in hand. Concerning which to ſpeak fully, is no eaſie thing, howbeit ſome particulars I will point at for your better concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it: And firſt, you muſt know, that this accord of a promiſe preſuppoſes the due order in which a promiſe belongs to the ſoule. This I would expreſſe in two branches.<note place="margin">1. Promiſes muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing from truth in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> Firſt, the promiſe, being a parcell of the whole truth of God, requires that the ſoule doe beleeve the whole truth, before it can beleeve ſpeciall parts of it: Faith being a reſolution of the ſoule into the meere verity of him that ſpeakes in the Word, a part whereof is a promiſe: Why? Becauſe it ſavours more of Self, then Faith, that I beleeve thoſe things in the word which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concern my own welfare, except firſt I be concluded in this, That God who is the firſt truth, and deſerves to be credited for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only, is the author of the whole word through. Hence Heb. 11.2.
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:45715:305"/> the Apoſtle doubts not to affirme, That by faith wee beleeve that the worlds were framed by the word of God, and that things now ſeene, were made of things not appearing. This is but a remote thing to the maine object of faith which juſtifies: But yet its incloſed in it, as the pearl in the mother of pearle; he that lively beleeves one, may beleeve the other more eaſily, as deducted thence. The act of juſtifying is an act of that lively faith which doth more then juſtifie.<note place="margin">Note.</note> So alſo true faith ſo beleeves a promiſe, that it alſo beleeves dogmaticall truths, practicall truths, threats, charges, admonitions, inſtructions; as well as comforts and promiſes, becauſe it lookes at him who deſerves the univerſall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reliance upon Gods truth for himſelfe, aſwell as for our owne ends. This for the firſt branch.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. In reſpect of Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, viz. firſt promiſes of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then of ſanctification.</note> promiſes muſt be beleeved in that order of immediate ſaving of the ſoule, in which the God of order hath propounded them to the ſoule: then we beleeve a promiſe accordi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g to a promiſe, when we firſt beleeve that promiſe which concernes pardon, reconciliation and life, and then proceed to beleeve ſuch as concerne government and ſanctification: Firſt, thoſe that are our being, then our welbeing: As in a fat of wares, firſt we muſt unfold and take out the upper, then the nether. The prime and firſt promiſe muſt be firſt beleeved, then the reſt: I ſpeake now of the priority of order, not of nature, to us ward, not the word ward, for ſo, every good thing is given at once to the ſoule, Chriſt I meane, and all he hath: But for us,<note place="margin">See 1 Cor. 1.30.</note> till we have beleeved the firſt of ſaving us, we cannot beleeve any other which followes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, <hi>viz.</hi> of mortifying a luſt, quickning to holineſſe. The like may be ſaid of the order of ſpirituall and temporall promiſes, till the former be digeſted, the latter cannot be. The reaſon, becauſe the firſt gives vertue, title and claime, yea influence into the other. This for the firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he who beleeves a promiſe according to a promiſe,<note place="margin">2. A promiſe muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the intent of the promiſer.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves it according to the intention of the promiſer: Each promiſe ſwims to the ſoule in the bloud of Chriſt, and therefore hath a ſtrong bottome, and undeceiveable. Promiſes are no looſe interlocutory words falling from the mouth of God, when he mindes other matters: Nor yet as mens promiſes, who firſt gariſhly make them, and after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them: but firſt God meanes them really, and then fulfills them. To beleeve aright, is to beleeve as the promiſe is, ſtrongly and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bottomed and grounded; they deſerve fully the ſoules reſt and affiance, not ſtaggering and doubtfulneſſe: We muſt not uſe promiſes as we would uſe little pegges or tagges, which though we dare hang our hat on, yet we dare not ſway our owne ſtrength upon, for they cannot beare it. But as we uſe ſome ſtrong brazen or iron crooke, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we durſt weigh our whole body; ſuch is the promiſe, Eſ. 26.3. fix thy ſelf upon it, for the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting ſtrength: Doe not as thoſe two Diſciples at Emmaus, who ſaid, we thought and looked that he would have riſen againe by this time, but now wee know not what to make of it; and yet Chriſt was even then riſen, and talking with them; when we warpe and lye aloofe upon a peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this is not according to a promiſe, but when we lye cloſe to it, as a foundation which will beare us up ſtrongly.</p>
               <pb n="572" facs="tcp:45715:306"/>
               <p>Thirdly, they beleeve a promiſe according to it, who beleeve it in the due limitation of it; and that in two regards: Firſt, of the variety of eſtates to whom they belong.<note place="margin">3. When a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved according to the due li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tations. In two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. 1. Of the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of eſtates to whom they belong.</note> All beleevers are not equally capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all Promiſes. Promiſes goe according to the need of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: Promiſes concerning croſſes, belong properly to the afflicted: Promiſes concerning growne ones, concerne the ſtrong: Promiſes to the weak, belong to novices. Promiſes touching them that ſtand, are of one kinde: and promiſes concerning them who are revolted, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidden, are of another. Each promiſe holds a naturall and geniall propriety to ſuch as they concerne. No true beleever ought to bee a ſtranger to any of the promiſes: But hee ought eſpecially to apply himſelfe to ſuch as are appointed for him. This is to put on Chriſts apparrell rightly. When men miſmatch the promiſes, looking rather at ſuch remote promiſes as leſſe belong to them, paſſing by the proper and peculiar ones, they feele not the true uſe and benefit of them. What hath hee to doe with promiſes of growth, who is revolted? hee hath more need of recovering. What hath hee to doe with promiſes of knowledge, who is puft up with that hee knowes? Hee hath need rather of ſuch as concerne the humbling of his ſoule. What ſhould hee trouble himſelfe with promiſes of ſupport in greateſt difficulties, temptations, perſecutions, who rather had need to bee better reſolved of pardon it ſelfe?<note place="margin">2. In reſpect of the variety of promiſes themſelves.</note> Secondly, in regard of the variety of the promiſes themſelves: for there muſt be a limiting of temporall promiſes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſpirituall. He that will enlarge temporall promiſes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in point of enjoying them, according either to the price which they coſt, or the right purchaſed thereby, ſhall diſguiſe himſelfe excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: For although they are fully purchaſed for all beleevers in point of right; yet not ſo in point of diſpenſation: herein wiſedome orders bounty, according to the object upon whom God ſometime enlarges,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.22.</note> ſometime reſtraines. All are ours, if we be Chriſts. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit not alway, for equall meaſure or time. This is our baſeneſſe, that we are carried to promiſes as the beaſt to her food; not by faith, but appetite.<note place="margin">Note.</note> Faith puts the knife to the throat, and reſtraines the ſoule to the enſuing of ſuch promiſes, not as her ſelfe, but as the Lord thinks beſt. And ſhe teaches the ſoule, that it's better for her that God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhould exchange promiſes for her, rather then give her ſuch as ſhe would chuſe and preferre, through lacke of diſcretion. For they are an hundred times better for us, which requite us an hundred fold in one kinde for ſuch as we forgoe in another, rather then ſuch as wee covet. If God will try ſome graces in thee, as ſelfe-deniall, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence under ſufferings, covet not thou the exerciſe of others, as of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, Cheerfulneſſe and Thankfulneſſe for Bleſſings.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4. When a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved according to the extent thereof.</note>Fourthly, they beleeve a promiſe according to a promiſe, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it, according to the fulneſſe and extent thereof. And this branch doth moſt cloſely concerne the doctrine in hand. As many enlarge promiſes beyond that which they import: ſo many more doe curtoll them, and ſerve them as <hi>Hanun</hi> did <hi>Davids</hi> ſervants, cutting off their clothes by the middle: They are ſtraitned in Gods enlargements, like <hi>Ionah</hi> who grudged that God ſhould be ſo gracious to Ninevee.<note place="margin">Jona 4.</note> As it
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:45715:306"/> is with Beggars, who qualifie the meaſure of their Almes according to their owne baſeneſſe, not the bounty of him who beſtoweth. A Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar will bee content with cleane ſtraw in a Barne to lodge in: But a friend will looke to be lodged in a good roome, and beſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Feather-bed. Why? Becauſe he meaſures his welcome according to his friend his beteaming heart. It ſeemes a great thing for a poore ſinfull wretch to obtaine forgiveneſſe; but as for other promiſes, hee thinkes them a farre off: Or, if hee get a few promiſes by the end, hee thinkes God muſt needs ſhorten him of others. But the Lord will have faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the length, depth &amp; breadth of promiſes; yea, the fulneſſe of him that filleth all in all. Unbelief is like <hi>Iehoram,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 3. 2 King. 13.18.</note> who being bidden to ſhoot the Arrows, and ſmite the ground, limited God to thrice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as God meant ſeaven times. Men having given us bread, ſend us for meat to another doore, and for drinke to a third: But the Lord will traine all his to know his doore, and none elſe, and to expect all from himſelfe. Men loath ordinary Beggars, and give at certaine times, but not ordinarily. But Chriſt Jeſus is yeſterday, to day,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.8.</note> and for ever the ſame, upbraiding no man. All promiſes of God are equally <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> in Chriſt, one as another.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. end.</note> Some one maine benefit there may be in marriage; but there are abundance of ſecond ones conſequent thereupon, all entailed to it: So is it here. So that hee who ſhortens and limits promiſes, doth not according to them, but contrary to their extent. Separate not the things which God hath put together: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make a golden chaine of one and other. If God will give me the beſt, <hi>viz.</hi> heaven it ſelfe, hee will not deny us the temporall. For the promiſes reach as farre as the merit. Chriſt died to redeeme body and ſoule from all diſtreſſes, though (as I noted) all ſorts of promiſes are not accompliſhed to all beleevers at all times, yet their right to them all is equall.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, he beleeves a promiſe according to a promiſe,<note place="margin">5. When it is beleeved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the peculi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rity and ſpeciall ufe of it.</note> who beleeves a promiſe in the peculiarity and ſpeciall uſe thereof. For although each promiſe hath the fulneſſe of God in it, becauſe it coſt the blood of the Lord Jeſus; and no peece of his Teſtament, no one Legacie of his could be made effectuall to the Church, ſave by his death; yet he doth not thruſt all the vertue of his death into one or two, or a few pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, but for the more cleare ſatisfaction of the ſoule, he diſtinguiſhes his good things into as many ſeverall and peculiar promiſes, as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of his people doe require. To the end, that every one that needs any good thing, may know where to finde it.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> And as Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries, who ſell many wholeſome Drugges, doe not ſhuffle all together, but for the more eaſe and certainty, diſperſe them into ſo many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall boxes and celles, where they may be ſure to finde them, when they need them, without miſtake or errour: So hath the Lord done, hee hath not generally and confuſedly put all graces and benefites into one promiſe; but hath diſpenſed them in ſundry promiſes. Not a good thing, but it hath her peculiar promiſe, to which the Lord will have all his people to reſort. And by this meanes he trains his people to be well verſed in his Scriptures, and to pick out promiſes as they lye; yea, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which ſeeme to bee made to ſome ſpeciall perſons, yet hee will
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:45715:307"/> have them (as the Bee) to carry them home to their Hives. As that promiſe which was made to Chriſt himſelfe, Eſay 49.8. he will have us apply it, 2 Cor. 6.2.3. That which was made to <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> Chap. 1.4. he will teach us to improve it, Heb. 13.5. And except there bee ſpeciall cauſe of the contrary, I mean that promiſes are proper to ſome, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competible to others: The Lord will have us ſearch each corner of his Word, to fetch out thoſe promiſes which lye there as gold in veins, for the comfort of his people.<note place="margin">Promiſes made to the head, to the body, to any member, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the members, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part, to the whole body, except a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation bee made.</note> All promiſes made to the head, belong to the whole body: all that concerne the Church, concerne alſo the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and ſuch as concerne one member, doth alſo reach to another, circumſtances being wiſely obſerved. So that looke what a poore ſoule would have from God, whether grace to heare and receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, to pray or worſhip God ſpiritually, to endure patiently, and take up her croſſe, or to mortifie any luſt, to get a ſoft heart, to be ſetled and ſtabliſhed in faith, to be kept from this preſent evill world, or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe, one place or other of Scripture will help thee to a promiſe for the nonce: by which (if thou have a gift to goe to the right Box) thou ſhalt much more clearly and fully reſt thy ſelfe upon God for a ſupply, then if only thou ſhouldſt conſult with general promiſes, which (though they containe the particular,) yet are leſſe evident, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe not peculiar good things with ſuch accommodation as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular doe. Our baſe ſpirits are content to generalize with God, ſo we have any promiſe, it ſerves our turne. And why? Becauſe wee uſe promiſes for faſhion, and make our ſelves thinke wee doe that wee doe not; whereas beleevers of promiſes ſearch out their owne Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in ſpecial (as if one ſhould ſearch a Will of a deceaſed friend) &amp; as the Angels pry into the Mercy-ſeat,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.</note> and look a far off to ſee what God hath promiſed. As common folke think they have ſtopt Gods mouth ſufficiently if they worſhip him any way, by ſinging a Pſalme, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Prayer, halfe aſleepe and halfe awake: ſo deale they with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. If they can catch any by the end, it is enough for them: As for culling out, marking or ſingling thoſe promiſes from the reſt, which might ſpecially ſtay, comfort, and ſpeake to their owne hearts from God, they have no skill; and accordingly is their gaine, generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, generall comfort. But I ſay, peculiar application of mine own promiſes, is according to a promiſe. Each promiſe will not ſuit to every neceſſitie; Speciall wiſedome and paines is required to get them, diſtinguiſh, underſtand and apply them as the plaiſters which ſerve for ſpeciall ſores.</p>

When it is beleeved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſcope and bent of them.</note>Sixthly and laſtly, he that beleeves a promiſe according to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves it according to the ſcope and bent of it. This is that which I ſaid in the proofes: All promiſes as they are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> in Jeſus; ſo they muſt be beleeved as they are in Jeſus. Moſt men ſcumme off the fat and ſweet of promiſes for their owne ends, leaving the lean and ſowre for whoſo will. But marke <hi>Pauls</hi> words there, Epheſ. 4.21. That yee put off the old Man, and put on the New. This is the pad in ſtraw, which few men ſee in a promiſe. They thinke promiſes ſound nothing ſave good newes, and that they catch at greedily: But the ſcope of a promiſe is another thing, as it coſt blood to purchaſe;
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:45715:307"/> So it muſt coſt us our luſts and baſe evils to forgoe. And there muſt be an harmony betwixt the purchaſe and the fruit. Chriſt proclaimes no man eaſe and liberty to live as he liſt; hee catches the ſoule by an holy craft of Promiſes, that hee may winne and ſubdue it wholly to himſelfe, who redeemed it: That every knee may bow, and call Jeſus the Lord, not boaſt onely of his ſalvation; but ſubmit minde, wit, ſenſes, will, affections, paſſions, purpoſes, luſts; yea, the ſtreame and bent of the whole man unto him. And in truth, hee who doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himſelfe in Jeſus, will not onely boaſt of him as Papiſts doe, Sweet Jeſus, ſweet Saviour, ſweet Chriſt: but will ſay,<note place="margin">Joh. 21.

They know there is ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation in all promiſes, as they are in Jeſus, that whomſoever Jeſus eaſes of his yoke, him he puts another yoke upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even of obedience and ſelfe-deniall, which to fleſh is irkſome, except hee who puts it on, doe alſo in the putting on make it ſweet and eaſie, as hee will doe to all beleevers. And theſe few may ſerve for a taſte to the reſt, for the due conceiving of this, What it is to beleeve a promiſe according to it.</p>
               <p>Now briefly two or three reaſons of the Doctrine: one may be this; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> becauſe there is the ſame reaſon of promiſes in particular, as of the Word in generall: But wee know the heavie denunciation of God, Revel. 22. end, againſt whoſoever ſhould dare to adde or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh from or to the Word; defacing it, by either making it a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter conſiſting of more parts, or of leſſer, then it conſiſts of properly. How then ſhould any dare to offer it to the promiſes, which are (as it were) the veines of gold in this mountaine, and the moſt pretious parts of all the Scripture, if any be more pretious then other?</p>
               <p>Secondly, except the promiſes be taken according to that no more <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> nor leſſe then they beare and import, what a world of prejudice muſt needs accrue unto the promiſer? How ſhall Gods honour bee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, if the ſoule enlarge promiſes beyond their extent: or to that which never came into the heart of God to intend in them? For then muſt the erroneous ſoule needs bee ſadly defeated of her expectation, and ſo be ready to mutter and cavill againſt God, and make him a liar. On the other ſide, if the ſoule limit and ſhorten God in his promiſes, what doth ſhe ſave impute that to him which that unprofitable ſervant did injuſtly lay to his charge, That hee was an hard Maſter,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> reaping where he ſowed not? What can bee fouler reproach to God, then both theſe? whereas by eſteeming a promiſe duly, God is vindicated, and ſaved from diſhonour, in both reſpects, as neither being larger nor ſtraiter then his Word.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, what a ſnare would it prove to the ſoule her ſelfe, to bee <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> alway in darkneſſe, doubting and demurring about the promiſes; for lacke of due underſtanding what the promiſes import. For why? The
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:45715:308"/> pith and marrow of the promiſes lies not in the words and outſide, but in the ſenſe and meaning of them, which who ſo miſtakes and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrues, muſt either deceive himſelfe in looking for more, or defraud himſelfe in looking for leſſe, then the promiſes containe in them? What a continuall vexation is it then to erre about the extent of thoſe things, wherein to erre, is above all other errors moſt dangerous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſſe? Many more reaſons might bee added, but the ſubſtance thereof will occurre otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> I proceed to the Uſes. Firſt, this point is Terror to all in generall, who doe not beleeve the whole body of truth according to it ſelfe,<note place="margin">Of Terror.</note>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>1</label> without the which promiſes cannot poſſibly be conſtrued aright. Now alas!<note place="margin">Truths of God muſt not be taken by tradition and prejudice, but from the whole body of truth belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as Gods.</note> what a common error is this? Who beleeves or deducts promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from the rocke of truth, as marble pillars digged out of the whole quarry? Men take the whole truth of God (for the moſt part) from the tradition of men, from the interpretation of others, which is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſave upon truſt, as their Parents, Maſters or teachers have inſtil'd it into them, and I grant its meet to be ſo at firſt, for ſo thoſe Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, John 4. at firſt harped upon the truths preacht by Chriſt by the information of the woman: But they did not reſt there, till by her they were drawne to heare him ſpeake himſelfe, and then they told her plainly that they reſolved their faith not into her report, but Chriſt himſelf. It is with many of us, as with Papiſts, who uſe the Church to bee the principle of their faith, whereas ſhe ſhould onely be a guide, an informer and directreſſe. Its not to be doubted, but the Church is the preſerving and ſuſtaining pillar of truth in point of guiding the ſoule to the truth; for had not the Church nurſed us, taught and train'd us up, where had we been? But this muſt not be enough to ſtabliſh us, except we meane to diſguiſe our ſelves, and bewray our ſandy founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when tempeſts and troubles ſhall try what is in us: no, we muſt put a difference betwixt our drawing to the truth, and our beleeving the truth, and never reſt till the bright morning ſtarre of the Word, the Lord Jeſus hath riſen in our hearts, who will caſt ſuch a through light into them as ſhall ſhine from Eaſt to Weſt,<note place="margin">Matth. 24.</note> and enlighten us in all truth, yea lead us into all truth by his Spirit,<note place="margin">Churches judgement muſt guide us, principle us in the truths of Scripture.</note> that Spirit I meane which aſſiſts his word in the hearts of all humble and teachable ones. This will cauſe us not to take here a ſhred and there another, ſuch a command, or ſuch a promiſe as pleaſes us, not knowing what to make of the reſt, but to ſet open our whole hearts unto the whole truth, the whole body thereof, that it may enter into us, poſſeſſe and dwell in us plentifully, in every part; it will preſent to our eyes that God of truth ſpeaking in his word, and piercing thereby into the very marrow and bones, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the thoughts, and carrying the ſoule into the ſtreame of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his, whereby we may be convinced of his truth, it will ſhew us the truth of the written word, in the eternall word of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, full of Grace and Truth, the way, the truth and the life; in whom who ſo beleeves to ſalvation, doth alſo beleeve all and every truth which ever came out of his mouth, and wee ſhall no more doubt of that then of Chriſt himſelfe, in whom all truth is eſtabliſhed and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, as the whole verge of a garment into one knot; ſo that as no
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:45715:308"/> man bids us to prove that its day light when the Sunne ſhines; ſo wee ſhall need no proofe or demonſtration of any particular part of the word, having embraced Chriſt that eternall word of God into our boſomes, becauſe he brings all his truths with him, and having him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe fulfilled that one great promiſe of his incarnation and redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath alſo in that made good all the other promiſes, and made them Yea and Amen, to the praiſe of his glory.</p>
               <p>Oh therefore,<note place="margin">The Spirit of Chriſt muſt be our firſt planter of truth in the ſoule.</note> how wofull is the condition of ſuch as forſake this way of faith, and goe to dig pits which will hold no water, boaſting that nothing ſhall ever pull them away from the truth, no feares, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, change of times, and I know not what! away with thy vain brags! If thou haſt not firſt planted thy ſelfe upon Jeſus, the body of truth, thy particular knowledge of truths will vaniſh of it ſelfe; for he who gathers not with Chriſt, ſcatters; but how much more when thy ſlight building ſhall be ſhaken with croſſes and enemies? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gaſter your ſelves from ſuch frothy bottomes as will deceive you, get truth firſt planted in your ſoules with the love of it for ſome reall and maine good which it hath done you,<note place="margin">Terrour to all Popiſh and blinde main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of truth upon error and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> and when Chriſt ſhall have brought his truth with the ſaving comfort of it into you, it will hold your hearts cloſe to it, never to goe from it, it ſhall keepe your hearts and mindes in the knowledge of God, it ſhall diſcover to you that rich hoord of promiſes which are hid in Chriſt, out of whom they are but as the ſound of many waters, and vaniſh as faſt as they come: This will teach us a rule of conceiving truth aright: This will ſcatter all miſts of error, darkeneſſe, miſtakes from the minde, and purifie the heart by the obeying of the truth, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.22. 2 Pet. 1.19.</note> yea it will be a light ſhining in a darke place, and guiding the feet into the way of peace: Abhorre then a patched confuſed knowledge of truth, deſtitute of the truth in Jeſus, as thou wouldeſt abhor and loath utter blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and arrant ignorance it ſelfe in the higheſt degree: For indeed (ſetting aſide the ſhew of it) its but couſen germane to it; who abhors not a misbeleeving Turke or Jew as a very infidell? Who loaths not an Hereticke, Papiſt, Pelagian or a Schiſmaticke, as we doe misbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers? Yea (in ſome reſpect) worſe; becauſe they are ſo leavened, that it is eaſier to draw a Pagan (not prejudicate) to the faith, then ſuch: Its true, that the other have more of truth in them then the other: But they doe ſo corrupt, confound and miſapply truths, they maintaine not truth, in the accord and the harmony of truth; therefore they hold truth rather to overthrow truth, then to eſtabliſh it, and in effect are greater enemies to the promiſes, and to the truth in Jeſus, then they can ſeeme friends to ſome kindes of truth, whatſoever their abettors, and patrons would or can ſpeake in their defence. So much for this firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and more particularly, its terror to all audacious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>2</label> ſpirits of hypocrites,<note place="margin">Of Terror. Hypocrites who ruſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on promiſes ere they be fitted for them, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> who boaſt themſelves of faith in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, having yet no right to a promiſe. Promiſes if aright beleeved, muſt be beleeved according to their order, not contrary thereto, and againſt the edge thereof: Ah poore creatures, and raw beleevers! Did you ever come under the condition of faith? Were you ever in a
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:45715:309"/> ſtrait, and at a deadly loſſe for want of a promiſe? Were you not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way beleevers from the firſt till now? Yes ſurely; you never came under the Law to drive you to a promiſe, and to make it ſweet to your taſte, drinke to one a thirſt: Therefore you dream of promiſes like brainſick folke.<note place="margin">Simil.</note> Once a phantaſtick fellow ſtanding upon a Tower, would needs have men to beleeve that each ſhip comming up the channell, was his owne; whereas it was neither ſo, nor ſo. Even ſo doe theſe: But know it, you have neither part nor fellowſhip in this buſineſſe of promiſes. We have a rule in Phyſicke, that humours muſt not be raw, but met and digeſted, ere they can be purged; elſe phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke ſcatters them rather into the parts of the body, then expells them. But if they be once ſetled, phyſicke will purge them: So ſay I to theſe, your luſts are violent &amp; fierce, not brought to an head, but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of conſcience, and the ſpirit of bondage; if they were, then perhaps the promiſe being applied in ſeaſon might purge them out; but elſe the promiſe is ranke bane unto you, and would rather diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe your luſts, make you more jolly, mad, reſolute in ſinning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare or remorſe, then rid your ſoules of them. Promiſes breed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the beſt bloud in mens ſouls, or worſt; if kindly appiled, according as the truth is in Jeſus; when the ſad Schoole-maſter of Rebells hath once ſent them to Chriſt, they breed the beſt, ſettle the ſoule, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce faith, and cleanſe the conſcience: But when they are catcht at by bold and preſumptuous ones, who (although there be but three ſaved, yet) looke to be of them, they breed the worſt bloud of all, even the bloud of impudent ſecure preſumption. Therefore away from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes all ſuch! hands off! be affraid to mix with them, Gold will not unite with droſſe, nor promiſes with you; rather goe to the terrors of God, which may (like darts) ſmite through the dead loines of your ſoules to tame you, and prepare you for purging: Goe to <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> firſt, to caſt downe every high hill, to fill every valley, and fit you for the King of heavens free paſſage upon your hearts, and then ſhall you perhaps ſee what a promiſe meanes; till then you ſleep under the hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches dangerouſly, till you be throwne into the ſtorme of wrath, which yet will not ceaſe then neither. Oh ye proud Phariſees, Papiſts, Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, what have you to doe with promiſes? As he ſaid to them, ſo ſay I to you,<note place="margin">Matth. 3.7.</note> what doe you here? Who taught you to eſcape venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to come? You are the vipers who fret in ſunder this wombe of promiſes: Can you indeed doe as you ſay, that is, fulfill, and more then fulfill the Law, can ye merit and ſupererogate? Surely then promiſes, and you accord not; your righteouſneſſe hath deſtroyed the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God: As for promiſes and Chriſt himſelfe, you make him but a ſtalking horſe to a proud heart, and as a ſtirrop to get up into your owne ſadle! when you have tired your ſelves in your owne wayes, and wearied your ſelves in your error, compaſſing your ſelves with your owne ſparkles, this is the portion which God gives you, Eſay 50. ult. even to ſinke in your owne ſweat, and to lye down in ſorrow. Behold all you that venture upon a promiſe, in this pickle, wonder and vaniſh, for you ſhall not beleeve the promiſe, though a man of a thouſand ſhould declare it unto you:<note place="margin">Act. 13.38.39.</note> That Doctrine that belongs to you is a
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:45715:309"/> doctrine of deſpaire in your ſelves, for your ſtout hearts, and ſtanding out with God. This Word muſt firſt caſt downe all high thoughts, and make you calme,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.4.</note> ere ever the doctrine of a promiſe can finde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into you. What have you to doe with peace and promiſes? Turne behinde <hi>Iehu</hi> the furious marcher,<note place="margin">2 King. 9.22.</note> arm'd with the revenge of God to humble your ſoules. So much for this.</p>
               <p>And thirdly (leſt I ſhould forget it) let this be terror to that genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>3</label> of Rome, who make no bones of the Lords promiſes,<note place="margin">Of terror. Popiſh abuſers of promiſes terrified.</note> but devoure them all whole, without ſcruple. Who can read thoſe uſurpations of the Romiſh Whore, and impudent claiming of promiſes, even the choyceſt of all which the Word containes for the comfort of the true Spouſe of Chriſt, in all her turmoyles under her malicious enemies? Dare they who are the tyrants, lay claime to the promiſes which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to the innocent Saints? The perſecutors themſelves to the promiſes of the perſecuted members? An harlot to the promiſes of the chaſte Matrone? When that wofull <hi>Gregory</hi> the Pope, called <hi>Hil debrand,</hi> or <hi>Brand de Hell,</hi> trode upon the necke of good <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth Emperour, he uſed theſe words;<note place="margin">Pſal. 90.11.</note> Thou ſhalt trample upon the Serpent and Cockatrice, and tread upon the Lion and Dragon: Can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny modeſt eare heare ſuch abuſe of promiſes? I ſpeake not onely for the malitiouſneſſe of calling a Lamb, a Lion, and Dragon: but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane arrogating of ſuch a promiſe to himſelfe, who indeed was one egge of this Aſpe and Serpent, whom Chriſt ſhall cruſh and deſtroy. But who wonders at this in him? Who takes upon him to make Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and marre it at his pleaſure? So he takes that promiſe to himſelfe, Pſal. 2.8. <hi>I will give thee the Nations for thine Heritage, and the Gentiles for thy Poſſeſsion.</hi> And thus he defends his unlimited juriſdiction. And againe, <hi>The wicked ſhall hoord up treaſure, but the righteous ſhall poſſeſſe it.</hi> Job. 27.16. This ſerves his turn for his raking in of Treaſure. So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>I will give thee the Keyes of the Kingdome,</hi> Matth. 18. This for the pardoning of ſinne. He might as well take one promiſe from the Divell, as abuſe ſo many of Gods; Behold, all the Kingdomes of the world, they are all mine, and I wil give them thee, if thou wilt worſhip me. Sure I am, of all other promiſes this moſt fitly belongs to him, upon the condition. But as for all other, Oh wofull prophane mouth, to chalenge promiſes contrary to their ſcope. <hi>Paul</hi> I know, and <hi>Ieſus</hi> I know; but who art thou? Terrors are for thee, not promiſes.</p>
               <p>Secondly this point ſerves for uſe of ſharp reproofe, and that of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>2</label> ſundry ſorts: Firſt, of ſuch as being under the condition of a promiſe,<note place="margin">Reproofe.</note> yet refuſe to caſt themſelves upon it. I ſpake of theſe before: but this <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>1</label> point enforces it much more. For what is ſo according to a promiſe, as that they who need it, apply it? But theſe dally with it, paſſe it by. Their ſeverall objections have been anſwered before. Now I onely preſſe reproof upon them. Light is ſowne for them,<note place="margin">Pſal. 97.11.</note> but they will not ſee it; but goe on with their burden, as if they would offer their eares to be boared for ſlaves. As thoſe mentioned laſt, are in one extreame, and ſnatch at that which is denyed them (for ſtollen waters are ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt: ſo theſe cannot make uſe of that which belongs unto them, when yet it is pind on their ſleeves: To whom I ſay as <hi>Eſay</hi> did to <hi>Ahaz,</hi>
                  <pb n="580" facs="tcp:45715:310"/> when he refuſed to aske a ſigne: Is it not enough for you to grieve men (Gods Prophets) but you will grieve my God alſo? What? Are you too well offered,<note place="margin">Eſay 7.13.</note> and cannot ſee when you are well uſed, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne your friends from your foes? Doe you thinke it is enough to nod your head (as Aſſes doe) at a promiſe, beleeving it onely as a tale told, but with-draw the affiance of your ſoules from it? Is it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for you to moane and complaine, to deſire and mourne? Are theſe faith? Is it better for you to ſhrugge in the cold weather, and to wiſh a fire, yet in the meane time to ſtarve for lacke of that which is offered you? To goe naked, and let the garment lye by unoccupied? Oh! checke your ſelves bitterly for this irregularity, whatſoever the cauſe be, whether unworthineſſe, or ſloath, or ſullenneſſe, it is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a promiſe, that I am ſure of. Oh! get your ſoules out of this emptineſſe into the life and marrow of a truth: Learne the truth as it is in Jeſus, that you put him on, being naked. Not to marry the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, being faire for it, is contrary to a promiſe. But to beleeve, and to caſt your ſelves upon the Word, to rid your ſelves of ſtaggering, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords moſt kindly with it. So much for this.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">

                  <note place="margin">Of Reproofe. Epheſ. 3.16. Pſal. 78.19.</note>Secondly, this reproves all limiters and reſtrainers of promiſes: for that is not according to a promiſe. The truth in Jeſus is the largeneſſe of it: Its length, depth, breadth, &amp; height, all dimenſions are in it. Thus thoſe Iſraelites ſtraitned the holy One of Iſrael: Can hee prepare a Table in the Wilderneſſe? This is our curſed ſpirit: when a promiſe ſeemes true in the generall, yet in the particular not ſo: as <hi>Martha</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes the power of Chriſt to bee able to doe all things;<note place="margin">Joh. 11.39.</note> but when it came to the point of raiſing her brother, then ſhe ſaid, Lord, hee hath been buried foure dayes, he ſtinkes. What a baſe carnall limitation of Almightineſſe is this?<note place="margin">Limiters and reſtrainers of promiſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</note> See what a contrariety is in our hearts to a promiſe, according to the extent of it. As the Cable ſeemes to a Needles eye, ſo doth all the points of an extended promiſe ſeeme to our hide-bound hearts. Gods enlargements worke by contraries, and make us the more ſtraitned; as in the point of the ſame, or the kinds of promiſes, and ſo the reſt. Now I thinke God hath heard my prayer: but how long he will, that I (ſaith one) know not: it ſeems too much to preſſe hard upon him ſo long, ſo often, for ſo many favours. True, if he were a man,<note place="margin">Jer. 2.13. Eſay 26.3. Heb, 13.8.</note> or a dry pit; but hee is a God, a fountaine of living waters: Men will bee weary of doing good; but it is Gods nature to doe it, as the ſtreames to flow. Who thinkes it a wrong to a fountaine to draw from it daily? Doth it not come alway more freſh and ſweet? It is the honour of a Prince to look at himſelfe in giving, not at others. The ofter thou commeſt to a promiſe,<note place="margin">Sundry inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it.</note> the welcomer. It is according to the truth, as it in Jeſus. Oh (ſaith one) I have truſted God for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but as for purging my corruptions, of pride, eaſe, vanity, the world: or if ſo, yet for purging or weakning this or that belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved luſt,<note place="margin">1 Kings 20.28.</note> cannot beleeve it. Why? Is God the God of the valleyes onely, not of the Hills alſo? So (ſaith another) I can truſt God for heaven, but not for outward things: for my ſelfe, but not for my children; while I live, but not when I muſt dye, loath I am to heare of that: or, for the preſent, ſo farre as I finde my needs; but what may
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:45715:310"/> hereafter betide mee in my name, health, ſtate, ſafety, liberty God knowes! Doth God know, and dare not you beleeve? Is this accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a promiſe, and the extent thereof? Truly,<note place="margin">Popery cares for no faith.</note> we have all a Pope in our belly: thats unbeleefe: we go farre onward in Religion: But we have hearts which ſhrinke in the wetting, and hold not out in breath and pace with promiſes; grudge and cannot beteame our ſelves the wealth and fulneſſe of God, leſt we ſhould be compleate in him, and too wealthy by him. <hi>Ionah</hi> grudged promiſes to others, but we are envious to our owne ſoules. I remember what once a devout <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, this reproves all ſuch as ſtretch out promiſes beyond their <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>3</label> bounds, and ſet them on their owne Tentors till they rend them.<note place="margin">Enlargers of promiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their due bounds, to be reproved.</note> They could beteame the temporall promiſes of God to themſelves and the Church, for deliverance and redemption from all enemies, for peace, protection and welfare, were unlimited: But thoſe which touch their ſouls, eſpecially to kill their luſts, they care not how narrow they frame them, even as the bed and covering of which <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeakes, that is ſo narrow, that it will not wry them warme. They beleeve not promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as they are, but fancy them: They chuſe rather that the buſh would not burne at all, then that it might not conſume in burning; where God ſtraitens they enlarge: Shalt thou teach Jeſus how to frame his truths? Surely this kind of receiving of truths, is not according to Jeſus, and the honour of Jeſus, but according to Self, and carnall ſelfe-love. Thou maiſt as well take upon thee to alter the whole frame of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as of promiſes, for God hath bounded them, and their land-marks cannot be removed. Apply thy ſelf unto them as they are, for they will not accommodate themſelves to thy humor, thy ſeaſons or contents.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this is reproofe to all, who beleeve not promiſes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <label type="milestone">

This doth intollerably trench upon the honour of Jeſus; this (of all the reſt) is farre from embracing the truth as it is in Jeſus. What is it which Jeſus hath not done or ſuffered to ſtabliſh and ground truthes? And yet how baſely doe we handle him in this? We look rather at our little ſins in our beleeving, then his great promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Oh (ſaith one) if my ſinnes had not been ſo deep died, ſo odious and long lien in, I ſhould hope well. Rather thou ſhouldeſt ſay, if mine heart were not ſo hardned, that I am paſt all feeling and faith, I ſhould doe well. If thy ſinnes have not driven thee to be deſperate in rebellion and contempt, they are not ſurely too great for mercy to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: Looke upon <hi>Manaſſe</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13. Though I were a perſecutor, a blaſphemer, and injurious;<note place="margin">Chron. 33.12.</note> yet mercy and truth aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Chriſt Jeſus: He ſaith not, ſinne abounded beyond mercy. Oh (ſaith another) But I have ſinned ſince my firſt enlightning, ſin'd againſt the remedy, adding drunkenneſſe to thirſt. What? Doſt thou ſo ſtill, and nouriſh a rotten peace, and a ſecure heart ſtill againſt the promiſe? No, but thou doubteſt that thy abuſing the meanes, and hardning of
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:45715:311"/> heart, will not be pardoned: But know that the Lord Jeſus his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings are of a deeper nature to merit, then thy ſinnes to deſtroy: He was made all ſinne;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.21.</note> ſatisfied for all ſinne, he was a nature of ſinners, not a ſinfull perſon onely; and therefore can pardon even them that murthered him: and not in vain is that example ſet down in Acts 2.30. to prevent that feare. They who come to Chriſt muſt come to him not as the greateſt ſinners onely, but as to the greateſt Saviour, able perfectly to ſave all who come unto him. The ſtrongeſt eye muſt bee caſt upon his ſtrength,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.25. Eſay 27.5.</note> not upon thy deſervings. The myſtery of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is to ſave to the uttermoſt, that ſo the ſoul may break, and God may be honoured to the uttermoſt. Well, but yet he pardons none, ſave ſuch as have faith, and how ſhall I know that he will give it me? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the promiſe that offers pardon, workes faith to beleeve it, and therefore its ſaid that it creates the fruit of the lips;<note place="margin">Eſay 57.16. Matth. 11.29.</note> which is peace: it offers eaſe to him that is loaden: if it offer the effect, it muſt needs worke the cauſe. But (ſaith a poore ſoule) this might be, if mine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions would riſe to it with ſome earneſtneſſe, but I am dead, and under infirmity. Nay, even then alſo can the Lord create this hand of faith in thee,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.9.</note> by the ſeed of the word: how did <hi>Paul</hi> lie under ſad buffetings, yet this grace was ſufficient for him. In a word, what ever the ſenſe of thy weakneſſe be, yet its Gods ſtrength which thou muſt take hold on to make peace, and that comprehends thy weakneſſe, when thou canſt not comprehend that ſtrength. So much for this.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, this reproves ſuch as runne to promiſes, without wiſdome, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>5</label> aptneſſe,<note place="margin">Unapt appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or other parts of the word, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> and the particular neceſſities under which they live. When they ſhould runne to the promiſe for comfort, they rather pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in running to the threats of the word for deeper humbling, that pleaſes them better, becauſe they thinke it may better be felt; but this courſe ſutes not with the truth as it is in Jeſus, which requires that each malady apply it ſelfe to her proper remedy. This cauſes the wound to rankle, not to heale. When men are called to doe ſome ſpeciall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and duty, they forſake that, and ruſh themſelves upon ſuffering, promiſing to themſelves that God will ſuſtaine them, and ſo provoke needleſſe ſorrow, like <hi>Ionah</hi> to themſelves, and all by their raſhneſſe. Others being called to ſuffer,<note place="margin">Jona 1.6.</note> ſhunne that and promiſe to themſelves ſtrength in doing: But this is to miſapply promiſes, for they alway at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon commands, and while we be in Gods way, not our owne: God payes no man wages for doing his own work. Others promiſe themſelves great bleſſings upon attempting difficult workes above their ſtrength, unto which they have no calling, leaving their Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ere God knocke them off, or thruſting themſelves into trades in which they want skill, leaving their owne, and the like. But the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer way for them, were to apply themſelves unto promiſes, which concerne thoſe ſpeciall callings, conditions and waies, unto which God calles them.</p>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>6</label> Sixtly and laſtly, thoſe are here to be reproved who doe in any kinde goe to worke prepoſterouſly with the promiſes,<note place="margin">Prepoſterous appliers of promiſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</note> contrary to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and uſe or ſcope; who ſeparate them from their end, which is to mortifie, purifie, and better the ſoule, as well as to comfort and pacifie
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:45715:311"/> it. Alſo all ſuch as miſtake, diſcover, darken, ſtretch, diſ-joint the promiſes, who take not ſuch a due meaſure of the promiſes as they ought, putting them on as they may beſt fit them, and ſo never come to the kindly uſe and fruit thereof as the Lord offers them. Of which I ſay no more, this ſhall ſerve for this whole Uſe of reproofe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this point ſerves for Exhortation,<note place="margin">Exhortation.</note> to incite and draw all who <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> would beleeve aright, to beleeve according to the uttermoſt extent and purpoſe of a promiſe; and not to defraud the ſoule of that due which the Lord allowes her. This is the way to engage the ſoule in God &amp; to walke moſt comfortaly in the life and practice of faith. God requires no ſmall ſervice and coſt at his peoples hands, which will hardly be, except the ſoule be deep in Gods bookes, and that cannot be, till ſhe come to beleeve promiſes according to their full extent. To this end, two things would be knowne. Firſt,<note place="margin">2. Queſtions. 1. How a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe beleeved.</note> what ſhould the ſoule doe that ſhe might beleeve a promiſe, according to the reach of it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly how ſhould ſhe practiſe and ſet this grace on worke? For the former of theſe, three things would be done. Firſt,<note place="margin">1. A promiſe muſt be ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> the ſoule muſt fathom and comprehend a promiſe truly, Eph. 3.15.16. That you may comprehend with all Saints, what is the length &amp;c. That which the woman John 4. tells our Saviour, I may ſay of this, The Well is deepe, and there is nothing to draw with. There is depth in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; but few are men of underſtanding to fetch it out. There may be enough in it, for ought moſt men looke after: their ſhallowneſſe diſcourages them from attempting it. Vertue is gone out of the Lord Jeſus into it; both for life and godlineſſe, this and a better life, in croſſes and bleſſings, for all turnes, ſo that each idle cavill of a baſe heart ought not to elude it: Hath God ſet it open for his whole Church to be filled with the fulneſſe thereof, and ſhall it not be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for a poore members ſupply? Accuſtome thy ſelfe to deal with a promiſe, as the marriner doth with the ſea, whoſe depth he is ever and anon ſounding leſt his ſhip ſhould runne a ground, and be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up. Thy miſunderſtanding may eclipſe the beauty of it, thy ignorance and blindeneſſe may fruſtrate thy benefit, but ſtill the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſhall ſtand nevertheleſſe full of water of life. Enlarge thy cord and plummet, that thy ſlight heart deprive thee not of both the view and of the uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, having found out the bottome and depth of a promiſe,<note place="margin">2. Draw out of this wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> beſtow paines, and draw waters plentifully out of this well of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, beſtow good labour and travell. In fetching up water out of deep wells, you ſhall ſee how many hands at once are at worke at the wheel, or pully, to get up the bucket. This is the worke of faith, alway to be tugging at the well with cable and armes, to get out this water of life.<note place="margin">Eſay 12.8.</note> Say thus, here it is put Lord by thy ſelfe, and to be had, I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by thy ſtrength handle a promiſe according to the uttermoſt of that which is in it, I will draw, and that with joy, for there it is and thus it is to be had. Its ſad working hereat with the moſt; but it ſhould be a merry work; we ſhould ſing at it, and deceive our toil by the ſenſe of our neceſſities, and the variety of thoſe ordinances, meditation, prayer, and the like, muſt be our hands, and unweariedneſſe muſt be our
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:45715:312"/> inſtrument. Take wee heed leſt through ſloath and a baſe heart, we content our ſelves with ſcrappes and puddle water, who might fill our ſelves with good things, and with rivers of water ſpringing up in us to eternall life.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3. Give not o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, though long held off.</note>Thirdly, give not over a promiſe, although the error of this wicked world, and Satan, together with the Lords delayes, ſhould weary us, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially under our afflictions. If our Lord Jeſus his diſcouragements could have killed the courage of that poore woman of Canaan, ſhe had never obtained a cure. Oh! our Saviour did what hee could to try, whether ſhe would be beaten from the promiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That Jeſus, the ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> came to ſave both the bodies and ſoules of all truly diſtreſſed ones, Jewes and Gentiles. But ſhe had ſo farre extended the promiſe,<note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> which Chriſt ſeemed to reſtraine onely to the Jewes, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the reſt Dogges, that it was ſtrange ſhee was not out of conceit, as one miſtaken: But, as if ſhe had been in his boſome, ſo doth ſhe hold faſt the promiſe; Though he ſay nothing, yet hee will doe ſomewhat, I will ſtill keep my right, he meanes not Iſrael according to the fleſh, but the promiſe, and ſuch an one am I. Shee knew promiſes looked not at the worthineſſe of man, but at the mercy and faithfulneſſe of God. Surely, I ſhall bee anſwered by and by: for I have the ſcope and end of the promiſe on my ſide. Faith had taken full meaſure of the promiſe by her owne want: and therefore our Saviour ſends her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the admiration at her faith. Oh! let us thus duly apply our ſoules to the ſeale of the promiſe, and it ſhall leave behinde it the ſtamp of all that vertue and fulneſſe which God hath put into it. A baſe heart not concurring with God in this largeneſſe of his promiſes, is as hard wax put under a faire ſeale,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> which takes no impreſſion at all from it, though clapt on never ſo hard. But as the ſoftned wax taketh all the counterfeit of the ſeale, and expreſſeth them to the uttermoſt: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo an heart rightly prepared, receives the print of the ſeale, letter for letter, face for face, yea, grace for grace. Faith is both hand and hammer to drive the naile of the promiſe,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.</note> given by one Paſtor, the Lord Jeſus up to the head. This for the former queſtion. Now I come to the latter,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. How ſhall we practiſe this duty?</note> how this duty may be practiſed.</p>
               <p>And for anſwer to that, this I ſay, Wee muſt know, that the life of faith in all beleevers, reſts upon ſuch promiſes as concerne their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be it what it will be; knowing that there are ſpeciall ones given us by God (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes, Chap. 1. and verſe 3. of his ſecond Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) for our ſupply in all needs. The ſoule then doth not fooliſhly miſapply theſe, but gathers them up, ſtores them like a wiſe Steward, both old and new, that ſhe may bring them forth in due ſeaſon; as a man would every morning put on the apparell of that day for his uſe and comfort And this is her putting on the Lord Jeſus,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. ult.</note> who firſt hath taken meaſure of her needs, and then offers himſelfe in his promiſes and ordinances, Word, Sacrament, Prayer, and faſting, and the like, to fit her, as her cloathes doe her body. Some of theſe I have already toucht in one of the Uſes before,<note place="margin">Anſ. diverſly.</note> upon the Doctrine of <hi>Naamans</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. A few more I will adde now, not preſſing the uſe of them, but barely preſenting them to your view. Sometime thy baſe heart
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:45715:312"/> feeles old guilt and accuſation of conſcience to returne, after mercy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and hope of victory enjoyed. But why is this? Surely, that hereby the work of Selfe-deniall might be perfected in thee,<note place="margin">1. In the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of guilt, ſtrength of ſin, cuſtome, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of it.</note> and ſinne might be knowne to be out of meaſure ſinfull, that it might bee more abhorred, and ſtronger faith in pardon and purging thereof improved. Claſp upon the Word for it, I am he who will heale all thy rebellions for my name ſake, both new and old: It is according to a promiſe, that the Lord ſhould leave none of thy corruptions unſubdued. Who is a God like unto our God (who forgiveth iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin,<note place="margin">Mica ult.</note> (marke how many words he uſeth to include all ſin whatſoever, both of nature and courſe; yea, ſinnes after the light of the Goſpel embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced:) And I create the fruit of the lippes, peace, and I will heale him.

Againe, perhaps thy ſoule meets with ſome eclipſe of Gods preſence, and forſakes me, ſo that I live in darkneſſe, and walke up and downe with a dead heart, without feeling. Well,<note place="margin">2. In the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart.</note> if it be by reaſon of ſome apparant ſinne againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, returne with a broken heart by a promiſe to God, Jer. 3.1. A man having divorced an Adultreſſe, will not returne to her: But if thou wilt returne to me, I will not reject thee. Returne, O yee back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding people, and I will have mercy upon you, and heale all your iniquities. But if the Lord bee departed otherwiſe, know it is not to forſake forever. For a moment I was angry, Eſay 54. But with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting compaſſion I will embrace thee. And in the Pſalme 55. The Lord will not leave his people for ever.</p>
               <p>Sometime the ſoule is afraid ſhe ſhall fall into ſome ſcandall,<note place="margin">3. Fear of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into ſome ſcandall, and not perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perſevere: but he who hath delivered, will deliver from every evil way and work: He wil preſerve the ſouls of his Saints: he wil write his law in their heart, they ſhall not depart from his feare: I am perſwaded nothing ſhall ſeparate, &amp;c. He is faithfull who hath promiſed. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſickneſſe, poverty, debt diſquiets, and how then? In ſix troubles he will keepe thee, and in the ſeaventh, that it ſhall not oppreſſe. Hee put his hand under my head, and will make my bed in ſickneſſe: when I was weake, the Lord holpe me.

               <p>Now I come to the latter part of the verſe,<note place="margin">The laſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. His ſucceſſe.

Theſe points I note here: As for the remoter conſequences following upon this cure, afterward I ſhall come to them in the next verſe. The cure then of <hi>Naaman,</hi> is that which in theſe latter words is to be conſidered; and firſt, of the holy Ghoſt his expreſſion:<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>His fleſh came againe as the fleſh of a little childe</hi> (for of this I will ſay ſomewhat) ere I come to the main point.

Who doubts of the perfect cure of ſuch a Leper, as was made of a ſcurvie, loathſome, naſty skin, like the skin of a little childe, that is, as whole as he was borne?

Say it be but in any one kinde, or diſeaſe, as a Conſumption, Feaver, Dropſie, or the like, eſpecially, if (when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have given over the cure as deſperate) they take it in hand, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it? What money, what honour is thought enough to requite a man? Nay, as Patients teach them, ſo, how doe Phyſitians learne to dote upon themſelves? And how will they boaſt themſelves like pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Kings of their ſuppoſed skill? Oh! if this medicine (ſaith one) wil not heale him, nothing in the world will doe him good. And another, I healed him (ſaith he) when no other could turne his hand to it. And, I will pawne all I have upon my skill, that I heale him. Could God himſelfe ſpeake any more? Let me not bee thought to ſpeake diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully againſt the perſons of any learned or religious Phyſitians, much leſſe their profeſſion, both which I honour, and am bound to doe while I live, for the good received from them, through Providence.

To the former, this, That as they are converſant moſt what about ſearching out naturall cauſes, ſymptomes and cures of diſeaſes: So, no profeſſion is more ſubject to Atheiſme and prophaneneſſe, then ſuch, except the Lord ſubdue and captivate their ſpirits and skill, under his Providence, making them ſervants to attend it for the good of ſuch as to whom God hath appointed life by meanes, and no otherwiſe. For why? Who knowes not but many recover of diſeaſes (in the judgement of Phyſitians) incurable? And how many there are in whom nothing ſave ſafety appears, who yet in the midſt of the Phyſitians ſecurity, dye inſtantly? All to ſhew, that the paſſages of life and death are not in mans hand, but in the Lords; who oft-times delights to blind-fold the wiſe and prudent in their own ſenſe, and to doe good by thoſe who are of meaner parts? Not but that the parts of learned Phyſitians are to bee eſteemed (who cannot be too well parted, ſince they deale in ſo pretious a ſubject, as the life of the moſt excellent creature, man) but that with parts, they joyne a God, adore him, and ſet him up in their ſouls as ſupreame and chiefe, treading themſelves under feet, in point of that Royall prerogative of ſaving life.</p>
               <p>Alas! how doth the Lord humble our confidence daily, when hee croſſeth our conjectures, and betrayes our folly both in our hopes of recovery, when there is none, and in our deſpaires, when there is no cauſe?

Oh (cry you mercy ſaith one) I forgot that, now I ſpeake as a man!

Doe I inferre hereby, that Gods bleſſings are to bee deſpiſed? No: But that God hath left a cracke in the beſt of them, in all of them; to teach poore man to Idolize none of them, but to ſet his heart upon better things.

                  </gap>ds promiſes are alway as good in the performing as in the making, if not better: for ſo falles it out with <hi>Naaman</hi> here. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet promiſed him cure of his Leproſie by waſhing himſelfe: And lo, now he is as good as his word, he waſhes, and is cleane in body. This is as much as was promiſed. But moreover (as appeares by the ſequell) he proves a cleane ſoule alſo, and this was an over-plus to the promiſe. It is a light thing for the Lord to heale his body, except hee heale himſelfe: And in this reſpect I may well ſay, as I ſaid before, That Gods cures are perfect indeed; all perfect gifts are from above; and all that are from thence, are perfect to purpoſe. Ere I come to handle the point, this I would premiſe (Brethren) how fitly this point followes the other, to make the heart and life of a poore beleever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. The former point told us, that promiſes muſt bee interpreted aright, and not miſtaken, not reſtrained, but beleeved according to the utmoſt extent of the promiſer. But then comes in a doubt, Though
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:45715:317"/> I enlarge them in their full reach, yet God may reſtraine them to the ſhorteſt ſize. True, if thou ſtretch them upon thy carnall tentors. But take them according to the word (as indeed thou ſhalt not need to make them better then God hath made them) and then this point will tell thee to thy comfort, that God will performe whatſoever hath gone out of his mouth to the uttermoſt, nay perhaps caſt in ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-plus as was neither promiſed, nor looked for. The Text is preſident enough for it, if there were no more. So that even in the entry upon the point, we may ſet a ſtarre in the margent, (and for our better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement both to beleeve, and in beleeving to waite patiently) may ſay, theſe two points carry very ſweet newes from heaven to a poore empty and hungry ſoule, both that he will have it beleeve to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt, and when ſhe hath ſo done, God hath in ſtore for her as much performance, yea, and much more then ſhee hath faith. But let us come to the point. The order I will obſerve in the point ſhall be this: Firſt, I will prove it by Scripture. Secondly, by reaſon. Thirdly, I will cleare a maine doubt about the Doctrine. And ſo laſtly come to the Uſes: and firſt of the firſt.</p>
               <p>Concerning which, this I may ſay, That the whole Booke of God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Gods perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances alway as good, if not better then his promiſes.</note> is nothing elſe, but a very Theatre and open Stage, wherein the Lord acts his part of performing of promiſes. And not ſo alone: But ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious the Spirit of enditing the word is in every Chapter and Verſe, leſt the reader ſhould ſpy any flaw or crack in the performance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; that it ſteppes out of his tracke oft-times to reconcile and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall each performance to her owne promiſe. And this both in the maine promiſe of Chriſts exhibition, and in all ſecondary promiſes, whether generall and concerning the ſoule of the whole Church and each member of that body; or perſonall and temporary promiſes, concerning this and that perſon: And the greater diſtance there ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med betweene making and keeping of promiſes, the more curious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard hath the Holy Ghoſt to expreſſe Gods keeping touch, when his time was come. For example,<note place="margin">Proofes and Inſtances.</note> God had promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> that his ſeed ſhould be ſet free after it was a ſtranger in an heathen land for four hundred and thirty yeares, and ſo it fell out,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.13. Exod. 12.42.</note> when the time came that God delivered them, what ſaith the Text? That ſelfe ſame day of that terme expired, the Lord brought forth Iſrael with her armies: So in the Goſpell, marke how curious the Holy Ghoſt is in expreſſing of the faithfulnes of God in each paſſage of Chriſt, his nativity, his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, his dwelling, his perſon, life, betraying, paſſion, death, buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all?<note place="margin">See through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Mat. 1.2. &amp;c.</note> Forty ſeverall times one or other of the Evangeliſts refer the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages that fell out, to the promiſes themſelves: That it might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled which was ſaid, And thou Bethlem are not the leaſt of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Juda: That it might be fulfilled, <hi>Rachel</hi> lamented for her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and would not be comforted, &amp;c. That it might bee fulfilled, Out of Egypt have I called my Sonne: He that ate with me in the diſh, he betraied me: And he was counted among tranſgreſſors:<note place="margin">Marke 15.28.</note> And upon my veſtures did they caſt lots:<note place="margin">Matth. 27.35.</note> And he ſhall make his grave with the rich: And he ſhall be as one of no beauty, like a withered branch: with a great many more. Not ſo much as his riding to Jeruſalem is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:45715:318"/> Behold thy King commeth, lowly and meeke, riding upon an Aſſe, the fole of an Aſſe. Why is all this? To let us to underſtand, that he who would be ſo punctuall in all petty paſſages belonging to the great promiſe of the Meſſia,<note place="margin">Matth. 21.4.</note> would be as faithfull in performing all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſes conſequent upon his merit and ſatisfaction. And the like ſpeeches are uſed to this purpoſe in the perſonall promiſes made to the Patriarkes, as to <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to <hi>Rebecca,</hi> concerning the elder ſerving the younger, to <hi>Iacob,</hi> that God would be with him in his journey, and bring him backe, and deliver him from <hi>Eſau:</hi> To the Church in the wilderneſſe concerning the poſſeſſion of Canaan, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> tells them,<note place="margin">Joſh. 21.45.</note> after the conqueſt, nothing failed of any one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar promiſe, which God had made concerning the giving of the land of Canaan to the ſeed of <hi>Iacob.</hi> Infinite many more inſtances might be alledged, as the fulfilling of the ſeventy yeares captivity, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of the Church backe againe to their City and Mountaine, as Eſay 57.13. All being pledges put into one boſome, touching the maine fidelity of God, in making good the promiſed Seed and Meſſiah ſo oft made and renewed to <hi>Adam, Abraham, David, Ahaz,</hi> and his people, which though it were kept in the bowells of time for foure thouſand yeares, yet at laſt, Gal. 4.4. When the fulneſſe of time was come, was accompliſhed. And hence all other promiſes tooke their originall,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.20.</note> and derived their iſſue. So ſaith the Apoſtle, All the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God are in him Yea and Amen, to the praiſe of his glory; that is,<note place="margin">Luke 1.45.</note> firme and inrepealable. Thus ſaith <hi>Elizebth</hi> to <hi>Mary,</hi> A perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance ſhall be from the Lord of whatſoever hath beene ſaid unto his handmaid: Faithfull is he who hath promiſed, who will alſo fulfill it. The Lord is faithfull, Heb. 6.10. and will not conceale the labour of your love.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.15.</note> This is a faithfull ſaying, and by all meanes to be beleeved &amp;c. endleſſe it were to reckon up all; and as for the addition of the point, that ſometimes he fulfills them for the better, we ſee what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.19.</note> Our God is able to doe for us more then we can aske or think. When <hi>Salomon</hi> choſe to aske a wiſe and underſtanding heart to goe in and out,<note place="margin">2 Kings 3.11.</note> lo (ſaith the Lord) I have given thee it, and moreover I have given thee ſuch wealth, honour and wiſdome, as never any had before, nor ſhall have after thee.<note place="margin">Matth. 6.32.</note> And ſo ſaith Chriſt, Seek the Kingdome of Heaven and the righteouſneſſe of it, and other things ſhall be caſt in. So that it was not <hi>Naamans</hi> caſe onely, but by conſent of Scripture, we ſee that his particular caſe, is made the caſe of each beleever, more or leſſe, ſo farre as is meet. This for proofes.</p>

God then is Jehovah, the being of all his promiſes, our God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Second Reaſon. God is faithfull in performances, in reſpect of his <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> owne honour.<note place="margin">For his owne honour.</note> He knowes that except he ſhould keep touch with his Church, and maintaine the glory of his keeping promiſe with her, hee ſhould deſtroy the credit of his Miniſters: the faith of his elect, and in a word, the hope of drawing any out of the common courſe of the world, to the Kingdome of grace. So that his unfaithfulneſſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning utter ruine to the whole art and way of Religion, either in faith or obedience, and ſhaking the very pillars of the Churches confidence; it muſt needs ſtand the Lord in hand to ſee his promiſes fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, foraſmuch as whatſoever is in God, is eminently in him, and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> by way of excellence (as before I noted in the point of commands;<note place="margin">Becauſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is in God, is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently in him.</note>) therefore his truth in fulfilling promiſes, muſt alſo be ſingular and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. It muſt become that excellency of his truth, not onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelfe with ſuch a performing as the poore creature can expect, and concur withall; but ſuch an one as is above whatſoever the ſoul can aske or imagine: that is, rather to be over, then under his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, better rather then worſe, this makes much for the adoring of his faithfulneſſe, and the beleeving of his promiſes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Lord doth thus for the continuall ſtrengthening of his <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>4</label> poore ſervants in better and cloſer claſping to his promiſes:<note place="margin">For the ſtrengthning of his ſervants. 2 Tim. 1.12.</note> and that by daily experience growing in the ſoule hereby, it might come to this pitch to ſay, I know in whoſe lappe or boſome I have put my pledge, I know in whom I have beleeved: I goe not upon had I wiſt, but upon undeceivable grounds. Thus, as the wicked through unbeleefe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves more and more to perdition; ſo the faithfull follow faith to the preſerving of the ſoule;<note place="margin">Heb. 10.38.</note> they grow more and more roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therein by ſuch triall of faith, they grow from faith to faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.17. Eph. 3.16.17. Matth. 11.29.</note> rooted and eſtabliſhed, and not eaſily puft off by every winde of error, feare, temptation; they grow from beleeving one to beleeve more, from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall promiſes, to ſpeciall, from ſpirituall, to temporall, from promiſes in peace, to promiſes in and under croſſes, darke ones, deep ones, long ones; ſo that no eſtate, ſervice, occaſion, triall, waxes ſtrange to them, but familiar, and at laſt the yoke of God waxes eaſie, and his burthen light.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, becauſe the Lords performances (or purpoſes at leaſt to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>5</label> performe) are the cauſes in a ſort of his promiſes. Its not ſo with men.<note place="margin">Becauſe his promiſes come from purpoſe of doing good.</note> They promiſe apace, but their ſpirit being backward in love, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire wel-wiſhing to the good of others, come ſhort of their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. Now the Lord in his intention or purpoſe to doe good to his Church and People, doth thereby draw his heart to make promiſes,
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:45715:319"/> that ſo, the good things which he wiſheth them, may be preſented to them before hand; &amp; they may know that in meer faithfulnes, he binds himſelf to them, not to ſtrengthen himſelfe, but their weakneſſe rather in beleeving. Now becauſe the Lord out of an Idea and foreſight of his owne free grace, purpoſing to doe good to his, doth breake into promiſes; thence it is that promiſes are eaſie to performe with him. Men are raſhly drawne either by their owne ſuddaine pangs or by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers motion to make promiſes, not knowing their owne ſpirits, and ſcantlings of affection, and ſo in coole bloud they undoe that which in hot they made. But becauſe Gods purpoſes ſtrong and firme, cauſed him to promiſe, therefore the ſame Spirit moves him alſo to performe. Againe, though men meane well in promiſing, yet inability often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cauſes them to breake againſt their wills; whereas in God, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of love, and power of hand to performe, are alway equall, ſo that nothing can come between barke and tree, nothing can ſet his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and performances together by the eares. Let the reader looke back into the point of Faith, where I have mentioned abundance of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Attributes in God, every of which are objects of Faith, and means to ſtrengthen it, and eſpecially his faithfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>6</label> Sixtly, and laſtly, the Lord ſometimes performes his promiſes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the better then otherwiſe,<note place="margin">Becauſe he lookes not at us, but his owne bounty.</note> becauſe he promiſeth not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what the narrow necke or veſſell of the ſoule is capable of, but what his bountifull heart can beteame it: Promiſes would prove but barren and bare matters, if ſo be our bucket could reach their bottome. But ſince the Lord promiſes according to the extent of his owne boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, therefore he performes ſo alſo, whether the ſoule conceive ſo or not. What heart can conceive the unſpeakable good things prepared by God for ſuch as love him? Eye hath not ſeene, eare hath not heard, nor hath it entred into mans heart to contain them:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.9.</note> yet all theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in the promiſe, and though the ſoule at firſt obtaining of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, ſee not what God includes in it to be in time accompliſhed, but is glad of a preſent ſupply of her need; yet the Lord who gives his Chriſt (the knot of promiſes) all at once, is content to keepe touch with the ſoule, and in due time to reach her out, all ſorts of them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as her need calls for, in duties, in wants, in temptation, in conflict with her luſts,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30.</note> or in affliction: Then he makes Chriſt, Righteouſneſſe, to be Chriſt, Wiſdome, Sanctification and Redemption: The leſſe the ſoule looked for it, the welcommer it is when it comes.

If the party promiſed unto, conceive not the extent of the promiſer, the promiſer thinkes he hath quit himſelfe well in concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the expectation of the other, although he ſhorten his owne intents. But this baſe falſhood of reſtraint is farre off from God, and therefore he performes that which often is unexpected, as well as what is. And ſo much ſhall ſerve for Reaſons. Now to the Limitations:</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Limitations of the point.</note>And they are ſundry. Theſe three following may give a taſte of the reſt, which becauſe they availe much for the due qualifying of the Doctrine, therefore I will mention them, and the proper uſes flowing from them, and ſo proceed to the other uſes belonging to the Doctrine. The firſt limitation is, That God though he alway per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:45715:319"/> his promiſe, yet not alway in that very kinde which the ſoule perhaps ſeekes and claimes. The ſoule lookes at one kinde, the Lord lookes at another: It is enough with him,<note place="margin">God performs promiſes al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>way: yet not in that very kinde, which the ſoule ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects. And why?</note> that he alway keeps touch in one kinde or other, though he doe not fulfill it as the ſoule would. And good reaſon, ſince the ſcope of fulfilling a promiſe, being the ſpeciall good of the ſoule that beleeves it; and the Lord himſelfe being fitter to judge of that, then the ſoule it ſelfe can. Therefore it is meet that we leave it to him in what kinde he will heare and performe. We, in the meane time cannot be loſers, becauſe the Lord doth not neglect to heare us in our kinde, for lacke of love; but through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bundance of wiſedome. If wee can beleeve, that the kinde which hee anſweres us, bee (queſtionleſſe) beſt for the preſent condition in which the ſoule ſtands; then may ſhee bee as well ſatisfied in Gods way, as her owne. For example: There is a promiſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.15.</note> that if wee call upon God in the day of affliction, he will heare us, and we ſhall praiſe him. Upon this the ſoule under any yoke of body, or minde, ſues to God upon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to eaſe that yoke, that ſhe may praiſe him. But the Lord, being wiſer then ſhe, holds on the yoke ſtill: howbeit he doth it, not as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of his promiſe; but becauſe he ſees there be other graces to be ſet on worke in the poore ſoule, as breaking of heart, patience, further faith, ſelfe-deniall, which would not worke kindly if the yoke were off. If he meant onely to exerciſe thankfulneſſe in the ſoule, he would deliver it: but he judgeth the other to be more uſefull for the preſent, and therefore chuſes a performance in his owne kinde, which ſhall bee an hundred fold more gaine to the ſoule then the other.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.3 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> being ſorely buffeted, not for ſinne, but to prevent it, prayes inſtantly to God to remove it. The Lord ſeeing that performance not to be proper for the end of his buffeting, continues it; yet hee breakes not promiſe: for he miniſters grace ſufficient to uphold him under it.<note place="margin">Verſe 9.</note> By this meanes he attaines his end, to humble <hi>Paul,</hi> and moreover teaches him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to live under deſertion and infirmity, ſometimes, that ſo he might get that experience of Gods ſtrange upholding of him in the want of feeling, which before hee had found under feeling. By this meane (though irkſome to the fleſh to want the uſe of graces and gifts) the Lord traines him to a ſober uſe of his revelations; and to renounce himſelfe ſo farre under buffetings, as to chuſe rather to bee as the Lord would have him, then as himſelfe choſe to be.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this qualification is this:<note place="margin">The uſe of this limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Both to coole our ſpirit of ſelfe-love, which is ready to appoint God his way of performance: as alſo to teach us wiſedome to apply our ſelves to the beſt good of a performance, rather then to the performance it ſelfe,<note place="margin">Gods people looke more at the good of a performance, then the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And therefore not by and by to cry out againſt God for not performing it, becauſe our turnes are not ſerved: But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by our defeat, to ſearch into the cauſe, and to ſee whether God and we looke the ſame way or no: If we doe not, we may bee long enough ere we be ſatisfied, or honour God in his faithfulneſſe. If we will tie God to performe one promiſe, and the Lord meanes to performe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we ſhall be farre to ſeeke. Say we therefore thus: Lord teach me
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:45715:320"/> to looke out what the promiſe is which thou aimeſt to make good. Faithfull, I am reſolved, thou art: but that ſtands not in ſerving my turne, but in ſerving thy ſelfe upon me. Since thou doeſt all things well, I doe but wait to ſee thy way, for it is beſt, and ſhall curb my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and give me beſt content; becauſe it tends to make mee more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, more humble, and at laſt thankfull to thee for that good which thy ſelfe meantſt me, which is infinitely better then that which I fancied. So much for the firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Limitation the ſecond. In generall promiſes to the Church, the time of performance muſt be left to God, and why.</note>The ſecond limitation may be this: In promiſes concerning the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Church in generall, except the Lord tye himſelfe punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a time of redreſſe or deliverance: we muſt conceive of Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances indefinitely without prefixing a time or period of our own: For in ſuch, it is enough for the quitting of Gods faithfulneſſe, that he performes really, although he leave the time when, to his owne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. We look that Gods love in hearing us for ſuch performances, ſhould trench upon his wiſe providence; but that ought not to be: In ſuch caſes it behoves us to diſtinguiſh upon promiſes. In ſuch as touch the ſoule and life of a beleever, uſually (except ſome ſpeciall thing hinder) the ſoules beleeving and the promiſes performance goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as, for the ſtrength againſt a luſt, for quickning up of any grace or gift, for ſanctifying of any ordinance. But not ſo in the publicke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. The reaſon is, becauſe the Lord may have a predominant way of his owne to barre preſent performance. He doth neglect the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall good of them who pray for a more univerſall good of his owne; either becauſe the ſinnes of his enemies, by whom hee uſes to ſcourge his Church,<note place="margin">See Gen. 15.16.</note> are not come to the higheſt pitch, and ſo it will not bee moſt for his glory, to puniſh or ſuppreſſe them yet: or becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations of his Church, and the ſins thereof, are not yet purged throughly, nor brought to the loweſt point: Theſe reſpects may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſpeciall reliefe of ſome preſent miſeries, reſtraints and perſecutions of his people. There is (wee ſay) in the motion of every planet, a ſtraight motion comming from the Planet herſelf, and a backward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt mover: So is it here, the motion of a promiſe is retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded and retarded by the wiſedome of the firſt mover. The grand promiſe of the Lord Jeſus his incarnation, was indefinite, and in the boſome of God, when to fulfill it: one thouſand, two or three thouſand might have brought it forth as well as foure; yet providence reſerved it to the end of the fourth thouſand:<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> And when that fulneſſe was come, nothing could ſtop the fulfilling of that, which yet before that time, no prayers, no expectation of the Church could haſten: Then, and not till then,<note place="margin">Inſtances of the point.</note> he that would come, came, and tarried not. So alſo, wee that live in this age, conceive our ſelves to be pitcht under the fourth viall, under which wee are warranted to wait for the revealing of Gods wrath, and the ruine of the Beaſt. But for us hereupon to limit God to owne time and period, ſeaven, or ten, or fifteene yeares: (whatſoever we may ſuppoſe by probabilities) and to determine God to our own ſeaſon, is moſt bold and preſumptuous: For God hath as well a way of his revenge and ſcourging of particular Churches, for their infidelity and unfruitfulneſſe, as he hath of fulfilling his maine promiſe. Sure we
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:45715:320"/> are, his Word will prove true within the Terme of this Viall: But to bound the ſpace and duration of it, we may not. That the Jew ſhall be called, and the Goſpel generally preached ere the end come, and that the Lord Jeſus ſhall even in this world expreſſe himſelfe to be the Lord and King of his Church, and ſet up his Throne viſibly upon their reall ruines, who (not waning braines) can or dare deny it?

Let us not cavill againſt our owne dayes as the worſt, nor our owne lot, as the unhappieſt.

For why ſhould we be deſolate, or haſten our owne ruine raſhly before the time? Let it be enough for us that wee beare witneſſe to Jeſus &amp; to his truth, and ſerve our time: But let us not breake out of our compaſſe, in which God hath ſet us. Nor let us think long, or tax God for ſeeming to ſtop his eare from our praiers, nor give over our waiting, and wax froward with him; but remember our Rule,<note place="margin">Acts 1.7.</note> That in publicke promiſes ſtill the time muſt be left to him who is the Soveraigne orderer of all times and ſeaſons. It is enough for us, that in the worſt and moſt degenerate times of all, God hath not left his Church as an Orphan, or deſolate, each member hath her owne particular faith and patience to ſet on worke: To keep the ſoule from ruſting, from either tedious impatience or deſperate careleſneſſe:<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> Ocupy theſe till God come, and theſe will ſo allay thy ſpirit, and exerciſe thy meekneſſe, patience and humility, that Gods time ſhall not ſeeme over long, faith ſhall not make over much haſte.<note place="margin">Hab. 3.</note>

And remember, that a thouſand years with the Lord is as one day,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.8.</note> and God is a pure act incomprehenſible, not ruled by time. I doe not by theſe paſſages, choke the zeale, importunity, clamors and expoſtulations of the Church? No, that were another extremity, and as much as to quaſh the Spirit of adoption, and to abridge the priviledges of the Saints, in their holy boldneſſe in prayer. For why? Read the moanes of the Church in Pſal. 40. and Eſay 63. and 64. the variety of her holy complaints, arguments wherewith ſhe laboureth to draw God on her ſide, againſt his ſworne foes: to perſwade him to be no longer darke, but to cauſe the mountaines to flow downe before his preſence. And ſo Pſalm 12. ſhe cryes out for help, becauſe all went to wrack. All this is lawfull, and to pray againſt implacable, incorrigible enemies: Plead thus, Lord, although to thee a thouſand yeares are as one day, yet it is not ſo with us: five, ſeaven yeares are ſomewhat to us; Lord, wee are feeble and faint, Pſal. 110. <hi>ult.</hi> Therefore tarry not long, Lord.

That ſin of ours hath vexed thee more then our croſſes and thy delayes vexe us. Purge them, remove the barre, and we doubt not but thy performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhall breake out as the light, when once our righteouſneſſe ſhall appeare, and our filthineſſe ſhall be cleanſed, nothing ſhall let thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes from being fulfilled.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Limitation the third. God keeps promiſe with them only that live by faith.</note>The third and laſt limitation is this, That the Lord keeps his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes faithfully; but yet upon condition, to ſuch as not onely are his own ſervants (for what have dogges to doe with the childrens bread?) but ſuch of his owne as abide ſo, and feare him, live by faith, and keep his Covenant. The ſum of the point is, that which <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 25.10. expreſſeth thus: <hi>All the wayes of the Lord are mercy and truth.</hi> But to whom? Surely <hi>to ſuch onely as keep his Covenant.</hi> Iſrael was the Lords peculiar above all the earth: but it was not enough for them to hold their name onely, but to keep cloſe to the Lord: If Iſrael would have walked in my wayes, then it ſhould goe well with them, and with their children for ever.<note place="margin">1 Chro. 17.13.</note> It was the Lords ſpeech to <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Salomon,</hi> Hee ſhall be my ſonne, and I will call him <hi>Iedidijah,</hi> the Lord loved him. And if he tranſgreſſe againſt me, I will chaſtiſe him with the Rods of men, but my loving kindneſſe will I never take from him. Marke (Brethren) there is a promiſe which the Lord will performe to all that are in covenant with him, that is, he will not finally forſake them. But yet in the mean time if they venture ſo much hereupon, that they break their league, play the harlots, and forſake their husband, he will make them feele to their coſts,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 16.3.4.</note> that he can alſo break with them and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them; and ſo will he goe on with them till he have wearied them, and by ſome adverſity or other, within or without, ſent them home
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:45715:321"/> with ſorrow and ſhame to their firſt husband. Men muſt not looke to be looſe with God, and yet binde him to be cloſe to them. Excellent is that of <hi>Oded</hi> the Prophet to <hi>Aſa,</hi> ſpeaking of the revolted ten Tribes, Of a long time was Iſrael without God, or a Law, or a Prieſt. And why? Surely, becauſe they had forſaken his Temple, and Worſhip, his Arke and Mercy ſeat: and therefore the Lord plagued them with all adverſity. And ſo will he doe to you: if yee cleave to him, he will cleave to you, but if you warp from him, ſo will he from you. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider (I pray you brethren) and God give us underſtanding. The Lord will keep promiſe with his; but then they muſt not play their parts with him. For why? Shall the Father ſpit in his Daughters face,<note place="margin">Num. 12.14.</note> and ſhall ſhe not be ſeparate from him ſeven dayes? It was the Lords ſpeech to <hi>Moſes</hi> touching <hi>Miriam,</hi> as you know. And ſo I ſay to us,<note place="margin">Levit. 26.21.</note> If wee walke contrary toward the Lord, hee will walke contrary to us; truſt to it. And that not onely in caſe of foule revolts, if wee ſhould play the Adulterers, Oppreſſors, Blaſphemers, &amp;c. Such ſinnes wee dare not meddle with (haply) for the lowd cry, and inward waſting of conſcience.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.37.</note> But yet (perhaps) we dare withdraw our ſelves from God by unbeliefe, fall out of love with his promiſes: wee dare forgoe our joy and delight which we have had in his preſence,<note place="margin">Jer. 2.13.</note> and runne to pits which will hold no water, as if the fountaine were unpleaſant: Wee dare ſuffer that pretious ſeed of Life to dye (if it may dye) in us, and walke deadly, coldly, baſely in our courſe: We dare allay and forſake our firſt love to God, and zeale to his truth: wee dare run to the courſe of this declining, formall, ſapleſſe and powerleſſe world, and ſhake off all ſpirituall cloſeneſſe and communion with God, and yet wee thinke to doe well. But know it, this is the great quarrell of all:<note place="margin">Levit. 26.25.</note> I meane the quarrell of Gods covenant, God will avenge it ſadly: his ſoule ſhall have no pleaſure in ſuch.</p>
               <p>Lay it to your hearts (brethren) and know the performance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, is the immediate way whereby the Spirit of Grace conveyes the preſence of God to his ſervants. Wee have no voice to heare, nor ſights to ſee, ſave the voyce and light of the promiſes: If we can cleave to them, we hold the Lord, and hee is preſent in our ſoules, as he was to <hi>Paul</hi> in that ſad darkneſſe, Acts 27.23. But if wee ſhake off the life of faith, where is our title to the performing of promiſes? or where is our right to the preſence of God? I remember what the Lord tells thoſe Iſraelites in the Wilderneſſe, I will ſend my Angell before you,<note place="margin">Exod. 23.20.</note> and he ſhall carry you forth in your journey: But take heed you grieve him not; for he will not ſpare you, but withdraw his preſence from you. So ſay I: We would claime Gods preſence, and God muſt bee our God, and performe all promiſes, as faſt as we gape after them: But in the meane ſeaſon, we leave the condition at large. Some of us have formerly been zealous, yea ſuffered for God, and loſt our credit, our goods, our liberties for him: Here was life and power; but now wee hold but a carkaſſe of the old temper, a meere name that we live, wee are growne Polititians, civilians, cloſe profeſſors, wiſe in our way, reſt in the fagge end of formality and common worſhip. And what thinke we? May we be as bold upon performance of promiſes as formerly?
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:45715:322"/> May we chalenge the preſence of God in his Word as formerly? No, no, others of us dare be forward with God, as <hi>Iona</hi> was, nouriſh our ſpirits in anger,<note place="margin">Jona 1. &amp; 4.</note> let the Sunne goe downe upon it, rage and raile like mad men in our moods? And if we be told of it, wee will defend it, &amp; we will be ſo: for we ſay, our wrong was reall, and fleſh and bloud cannot beare it. What? Will you flye from God, and looke that hee ſhould follow you up and downe,<note place="margin">Judg. 19.3.</note> as the fooliſh Levite did his who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Concubine? Others of us dare abuſe the Sabbath, or elſe have no delight in it, ſpeaking our owne words. Others cannot be rated off from the creature, but run after our profits, wills, vanities, pleaſures, faſhions; and cocker our children therein without checke. Others will take the uttermoſt of our liberties, and goe upon the brinke. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers regard not our families, ſet not up the worſhip of God there, or pray for faſhion. Others are growne juſt to the frame of the times, and give God ſo much, and no more then the common ſort doe, and yet paſſe well. And ſo I might be endleſſe. But know it (Brethren) Gods promiſes are like himſelfe, and are faithfully performed on his part, howbeit if this be our frame, we ſhall finde a change, and hee will take in his Sun-ſhine, we ſhall not finde his preſence as in former times to us?<note place="margin">Job 6. and throughout.</note> Did the Lord withdraw himſelfe from holy <hi>Iob,</hi> while he walked in uprightneſſe, and eclipſe his preſence and promiſes from him, write bitter things againſt him, compaſſe him about with terrors, hide his face, and all juſtly, even to humble him more deeply, and prevent that which elſe proſperity might have bred in him? Wonder not then (bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) if the Lord withdraw himſelfe from us, and turne away his performing of promiſes, into breach of covenant, when hee meets with ſuch ſcurfe as this in our hearts and lives. And let the uſe of the point in Gods name be this (which I pray us all to oberve) that henceforth we ceaſe to wonder if wee finde the Lord otherwiſe towards us, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, ſo long as the quarrell of his Covenant depends. I grant that there were never any dayes ſuch as ours in point of complaint of Gods abſence, darkneſſe, and not performing of promiſes. But withall conſider when were there ſuch wofull dayes of Revolts &amp; Apoſtaſies from God, and the power of his truth, as now? Each face is pale, and each hand is upon the pained ſide: But it is rather becauſe men may not have their will of God, and keep him cloſe in performance of promiſes, when yet their lives ſwarme with all abominations? Should I not be avenged of ſuch time-ſervers and hypocrites as theſe, (ſaith the Lord in the Prophet) doe you wonder if hee have hidden himſelfe,<note place="margin">Eſay 1.</note> and doth count you as you are, refuſing to performe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?

               <p>Now it is time that we haſten to other Uſes of the Doctrine. A

As <hi>Naomi</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ruth,</hi> Reſt and be ſtill, for the man will not be quiet in himſelfe till he bring the matter about, leave it to him: ſo let us doe. God needs not our negotiouſneſſe, or double diligence to bring his matters to paſſe, he can doe them beſt himſelfe: And yet ſo it is, that as in all other lawfull actions we muſt come in, and chop our gourds in the pottage to defile it, ſo eſpecially in the performing of promiſes. Our mixtures muſt be added, our humors and extremities, or elſe all is marred.

Juſt ſo is it in this buſineſſe with moſt men. From the chiefe promiſe of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the leaſt and loweſt, we muſt have a finger in the worke, and promiſes muſt paſſe through our diſpatch. To give God the honour of fulfilling, as well as promiſing, is too difficult for us. And thence it is, that we ſo hardly obtaine the promiſes, they ſticke betweene our fingers, our haſtnings our feares, our dallying, our preſumption cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſo much ſorrow betwixt the making and performing of promiſes.

For, what might be the cauſe why <hi>Iſaac</hi> fetcht over the bleſſing the ſecond time, ſave onely to reprove the indirect courſe that <hi>Rebecca</hi> had taken? Its true, that the ſpirituall birthright tooke effect from the preſent: But the temporall was delayed ſix or ſeven hundred yeares; till <hi>David</hi> brought Edom under bondage, I ſubmit my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to wiſer men, and I doubt not, but other cauſes may be alledged; but why might not the promiſe have taken effect ſooner, if ſhee had ſuffered the Lord to take his courſe?

Who doubts but that God guided all? Yet I ſee not, but we may ſuſpect God to have had an hand of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for this prevention of his performances. As the midwives ſubtilty ſpake of the Iſraelitiſh women to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 2.19.</note> That they were lively, and needed not them: So I may ſay, Gods promiſes are live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and need no midwifery of ours, they are not ſo weake that our wiſdome need bring them to the birth. Yet (brethren) we cannot be kept from venturing. God hath promiſed to be alſufficient, yet, as if he could not be ſo without us, we muſt ſtep forth, and beſtirre us with uſing ſome indirect meane or other to purchaſe a performance: God
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:45715:323"/> hath promiſed to bleſſe us in all we put forth our hand to; but if wee marry a childe, or purchaſe a commodity, we muſt uſe ſuch a deale of our owne indirect wit and pollicy and fetches, that by that time wee have done, he that lookes upon the iſſue may halfe doubt whether the performance be Gods or our owne; at leaſt if it be Gods, yet it is ſooted and crocked with ſuch a deale of our owne, that it hath almoſt loſt his beauty. And hence it is, that as it was with <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſo it is with us (though in a far divers kinde) our ſtriving with God, makes us halt ever after, and commonly we carry ſome odde marke or other about us, for our interblending Gods performances with our inventions. Let us learne then to let God alone, that we may enjoy ſuch a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his promiſe, as beſt ſutes with his owne will and way; let us count it our ſtrength to ſit ſtill, Eſay 30. ſo ſhall we not bee in love with our owne nets, nor intervert the entire praiſe due to God, to our owne wits, but take Gods worke home to our ſelves, and yeeld him the fruit of our praiſe as himſelfe requires, Pſal. 50. ult.

For the lender wants his money or bargaine for the preſent, and is damnified by diſappointment; forfeits ſometimes are hazardable, but to be ſure, they require a longer time of traverſe then can be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: yet in ſome caſes I ſay that civill bonds, becauſe their forfeit is a double mulct and loſſe to the forfeiter, may be conceived to ſatisfie the Law, when the honeſty of the party cannot be queſtioned. But it is
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:45715:324"/> not in criminall caſes as in civill; for in criminall, the deſerter of his bond takes himſelfe to be eaſed by the deſerting of it, and not damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by it; now the party queſtioned muſt not be his own carver to eaſe <label type="milestone">

If our cauſe be bad, wee had need judge our ſelves, if good, we muſt looke up to him that is higher then oppreſſors.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to deſert criminall bonds concurres not with the intents of them that binde who truſt to our fidelity, and would not elſe have taken bonds, and therefore eaſe us the whilſt, but rather open their mouth againſt us for equivocators, Jeſuits and hypocrites, which we ought not to occaſion, becauſe it hath ranke appearance of evill. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the caſe may ſtand, the conſcience of the bound party at the binding was convinced of no other, ſave of an honeſty, and obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry promiſe to preſent himſelfe according to bond: now to overrule an act paſt by a latter information, or ſecond thoughts, is unjuſt, and cannot but ſnare his conſcience: Therefore it is unlawfull. Fourthly, its ſcandalous and prejudiciall to the cauſe of Religion, which all thoſe who are religious carry in their foreheads as well as in their boſomes, and therefore muſt be very tender and cautelous of; I ſay how Gods cauſe ſuffers through us, and leſt by our ſides the body of Religion be wounded: yea (as the caſe may ſtand) although wee had ſome ſtrong reaſon for our action, yet becauſe the wound is broader then our plaiſter, we ſhould be wary. Fifthy, the deſerting of bonds in ſuch caſes, imputes very ſhrewdly to the cauſe we are engaged in, and inferres a deſerting of it, which is a ſad buſineſſe for him who thinkes his cauſe honeſt: and if it be alledged, that he doth it to avoid a ſadder pinch, I anſwer, no pinch of penalty is comparable to pinch of conſcience. Sixtly, by this meane, we deſert not onely our bond and cauſe, but even that whereby we profeſſe to be underpropped, <hi>viz.</hi> the uſe of our faith in ſuffering, and in our wel-doing to commend our ſelves to God as a faithfull keeper? What place is there left for God to protect us, to quit our perſons, to plead our cauſe, to honour his truth againſt oppoſition, when we our ſelves cut off and prevent his providence our ſelves by our diſcretion? I have ſaid enough, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome may thinke too much: but I have conſiderately done it, not in any unkindeneſſe (God knowes) but firſt,<note place="margin">Apology for the Authors intent herein.</note> becauſe it hath ever beene my judgement. 2. In ſome reſpects I feele my ſelfe called to profeſſe it. 3. I hope by this meanes to ſtoppe the like courſe in ſome. 4.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He laſt day (Beloved) as you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I made an end of the former Doctrine, iſſuing out of the ſucceſſe of <hi>Naamans</hi> waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: To wit, that Gods performances are alway as good as his promiſes, if not better. Now the laſt point of the whole verſe, and ſo, of the third generall part of this text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth to be handled. And that is grounded upon this, That now after <hi>Naamans</hi> faith and fruition of the promiſed cure, wee heare no more of his old diſtempers, his cavils, his rage and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the Prophet. All is now quite changed with him, as for ſorrow and former trouble all is blowne away, as if it had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been. The point is of ſingular conſequence, and it is this, The ſoule that can caſt her ſelfe nakedly upon the bare promiſe of God, may be ſure thereby to loſe all her diſtempers, which (under her unbeliefe) aſſaulted her: and to drowne them in the promiſe. And this point I will firſt ground upon Scripture and reaſon: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, anſwer a queſtion or doubt: Then come to ſome uſe. For the ground of the text, it is cleere: For we ſee that according to the promiſe of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> ſo it came to paſſe. After his waſhing himſelfe, we heare of no more diſtempers: all are gone: wee heare of the returne of his fleſh as a childs: we heare not of the remainder of his paſſions. For other texts: Take that place, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 26.2. <hi>Salvation will God appoint for wals and bulwarkes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 26.1, 2, 3.</note> What is that? The Church under the Goſpel ſhould faſten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="830" facs="tcp:45715:330"/> the promiſe for ſalvation: and this ſhould fence out all her troubles and former enemies, as a Wall or a Bulwarke, keepes out any affronts, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Thou wilt keepe him in perfect peace, whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee, becauſe he truſteth in thee.</hi> As the needle of the Diall ſet juſt on the North point, ſettles and ſhakes not: and as the Anchor holds in the Ship from floating up and downe: ſo the promiſe faſtned upon, ſtabliſheth the ſoule from her former wanzings, and unſetledneſſe. And the reaſon is more fully ſet downe in <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Truſt yee in the Lord for ever, for the Lord</hi> JEHOVAH <hi>is everlaſting ſtrength:</hi> that is, he is reall in all his promiſes, and gives a being to them, as being ſtrong enough to doe it. Hence it is, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 55.4. That the Lord Jeſus in the offer or promiſe, is called a <hi>Witneſſe: Behold, I have given him for a Witneſſe to the people:</hi> And in <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. <hi>That faithfull and true Witneſſe:</hi> Why? becauſe he is Yea, and Amen, all the promiſes of God in him, become ſo. Now, as a Witneſſe in the Court, who is ſworne, and without exception, decides the Controverſie betweene two at oddes: ſo the promiſe beleeved, quits the ſoule, and puts an end to ſtrife. So in the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the promiſe beleeved, is compared to a City of refuge, which reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the poore man-ſlayer, whoſe heart was full of feare, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, becauſe of the purſuer; but there he was free: even ſo, the oath and promiſe of God, received into the ſoule, determines all doubts betweene the Lord and her. It is ſaid of <hi>Hanna,</hi> that ere <hi>Eli</hi> had reſolved her from God, of a ſonne, ſhee was full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in ſpirit: But, when once hee had ſatisfied her, lo, then ſhee was cheerefull, and look'd no more heavily: even ſo is it with the promiſe faſtning upon the ſoule, it cauſes the waves and ſtormes of an unquiet heart to turne to a calme. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was mightily troubled upon the meſſage of death; but no ſooner came <hi>Eſay</hi> backe againe, with the newes of his recovery, and the ſigne of the Suns going back, but <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> moane was turned to a ſong. So is it here. For is there not more in a promiſe of Chriſt, and preach'd to the ſoule in his name, then in all the promiſes of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall deliverances, which were more darkly derived from him? Yes verily. Hence it is, that the Prophets never deſcribe the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Chriſt in his word, but they runne very much upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription alſo of this effect, of chaſing away of all ſpirituall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers. Upon all the glory, ſhall be a defence: and there ſhall be no more weeping, nor mourning upon his mountaine. In ſtead of the Bramble,<note place="margin">Eſay <hi>55.</hi> ult.</note> ſhall be the Myrtle, and in ſtead of the Thorne, ſhall come the Firre: What's that? all ſhall bee new, the face of things ſhall be changed, Teares ſhall be wiped from all eyes: with many ſuch phraſes, as come not to mind: each chapter is full of them. So <hi>Job</hi> 22.29. When men are caſt downe, then thou ſhalt ſay, There is a lifting up, and hee ſhall ſave the humble man. Lo, conſternation and terrors ceaſe by beleeving. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.6. <hi>For this cauſe ſhall every good man pray, in a time of finding: The flouds of great waters ſhall not come
<pb n="831" facs="tcp:45715:330"/> neare him.</hi> And examples are as evident as other Scriptures. How was <hi>Cornelius</hi> by <hi>Peter,</hi> the <hi>Eunuch</hi> by <hi>Philip,</hi> the <hi>Jaylor</hi> by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> freed from their doubts and demurres, and ſet at liberty?</p>
               <p>Reaſons are many and weighty. Firſt, this appeares by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion:<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> if we compare the priviledges of Beleevers together, we ſhall find, that there be as many as concerne them in point of freedome from their inward diſtempers, as outward enemies. But the beleever is really ſet free from enemies, Devill, curſe, law, wrath of God, an evill world, the gates of hell: elſe whence come thoſe triumphs, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? O hell, where is thy victory? The ſting of death is ſinne, and the ſtrength of ſinne is the law</hi> (incenſing ſinne;) <hi>But thankes be to God, &amp;c.</hi> Now, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption deliver us from enemies, (ſo that they ſhall not hurt us) from all croſſes, ſtraits, tribulations, (ſo that they ſhall not ſeparate us from the love of God) ſhall not then Juſtification free us from inward horrours, feares, guilt, doubt of conſcience, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of ſinne, cavils, prejudice, and diſtempers? Shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation ridde us of our enemy, and that ſhame and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſinne brought upon us? Yea much more, for both come from faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the contrariety of eſtates proves it, before and after <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> faith. The condition of the wicked is, That they can have no peace: there is none to them, <hi>Eſay</hi> 57. <hi>ult.</hi> becauſe as the winter aire is never temperate, by reaſon of thoſe moiſt and cold vapors which annoy the aire with winds, tempeſts, froſt, and ſnow, and the like: ſo the coaſt of their ſpirits can never be cleare, becauſe of the guilt of their conſciences: they may now and then pleaſe themſelves with a little truce, but ſtill warre returneth, the dint of their feares is not broken: So on the contrary, There is no warre to the ſoule that beleeves. As the aire perfectly clenſed in the ſummer, is ſetled, and affords a continuall calme, ſo doth the conſcience of a beleever. Now and then may be over-caſtings of clouds, but the dint of guilt and wrath is gone.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, elſe we ſhould aſcribe more to particular promiſes <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> and the effect thereof, which are weaker, then to the maine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which is the <hi>Reuben,</hi> the firſt borne of God, and the ſonne of his ſtrength. But we ſee what particular promiſes have done to them who have beene under ſad diſtempers by affliction: Of <hi>Hanna,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> I have ſpoken before. Adde another: The Lord promiſed the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that upon the ſprinkling of their door-poſts with the bloud of the Paſſeover,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.</note> the Angel of the Lord ſhall paſſe over their houſes and ſmite none of them: Did they find any diſtempers poſſeſſe them, when there was out-cry throughout all <hi>Egyt</hi> in every family? No ſurely, they ſlept ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their beds. Did they doubt of the victory againſt <hi>Ai,</hi> when as they had received a promiſe of victory? or were they afraid as at firſt, when thirty of them were ſlaine? No. When the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made of the fall of the wals of <hi>Jericho</hi> by the ſounding
<pb n="832" facs="tcp:45715:331"/> of Rams hornes, and compaſſing the City ſeven times, did the people ſtagger at it? were they not reſolved? And ſhall not the maine promiſe of God remove diſtempers within, as well as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions without? yes, and much more.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>4</label> Fourthly, the contrariety of corrupt infidelity, and the power of the promiſe doth evince it. The ſtrength of infidelity ſtands in bearing downe the word. Whatſoever diſtemper of heart can be mentioned, either ſelfe, carnall reaſon, rebellion, or the like, comes from the not ſuffering the word to enter, but holding it out at ſtaves end. Now then muſt not the word of promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved become as contrary to her? Why did <hi>Micaiah</hi> ſo ſcare <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab?</hi> Becauſe he never ſpake well to him. So why doth the grace of faith ſo ſcatter theſe diſtempers? Becauſe ſhe ſpeakes all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, overthrowes and reſiſts them. Contraries have mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually the ſame reſpect in their conſequencies. The diſtemper of an unbeleeving ſpirit, alway beares downe the word, till the word (as the ſtronger man armed with the power of Chriſt) doe foile her, and ſtrip her of all. The weapons of our warfare are not carnall, but ſpirituall, able to caſt downe ſtrong holds of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: Sinnes weapons are carnall, Gods are ſpirituall: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no proportion in the contrariety: God will divide the ſpoyles, that is, ceaſe the diſtempers. The reaſon appeares from that ſpeech of <hi>Jonah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ionah</hi> 2.8.</note> They that embrace lying vanities, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their owne mercy: But I will looke toward thy holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and promiſe, and thereby abandon them. Each deſtroy the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>5</label> Fifthly, the promiſe drownes all former diſtempers, becauſe it performes that really, which ſelfe and corruption beare the ſoule falſly and erroneouſly in hand withall: Theſe afford the ſoule a rotten peace, a deceitfull content, vaniſhing, and ending in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. See <hi>Eſay</hi> 50.11. But the word doth it really, and ſurely, no more to be infringed. No more hungring or thirſting, if once ſatisfied with this bread and water of life. The text imports it, <hi>Naamans</hi> ſervants here tell <hi>Naaman,</hi> That which all thine owne diſcontents and humours could never miniſter unto thee, that the obeying of the meſſage will really afford thee. See <hi>Act.</hi> 13.38. That from which you could not be juſtified from by the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by this Man, every beleever is juſtified: All at once ſet free from outward enemies, and inward diſtempers.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>6</label> Sixthly, the experience of the Saints proves this; who, till they have caſt anchor upon the word, and ſettled upon this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, could never find reſt in all the circumference (as I may call it) of your owne beſt ſelfe, your goodneſſe, affections, gifts, or duties: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe confeſſing, that in reſpect of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of our good workes, or elſe the perill of vaine-glory iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing from thence, it is moſt ſafe for us to rely upon the ſole and meere mercy of God: the bare word of truth and promiſe. How much more then ſhall Gods people ſay, If it had not beene for thy word, I had periſhed in my affliction? This is to a poore
<pb n="833" facs="tcp:45715:331"/> ſoule, as the chaire of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is to a deluded votary, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining voyce. All eternall, immutable things comprehend and devoure the fading and changeable, but cannot be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by them, nor reſiſted by their oppoſition.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the maine and chiefe reaſon of all is, becauſe the word <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>7</label> and promiſe of God, is not the bare letter of words or ſyllables,<note place="margin">Many branches</note> but furniſh'd with all the power and authority of God: ſo that, who ſo clings and cleaves to it, is out of his owne keepe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Lords. There is (as our Saviour ſpeakes) ſpirit and life,<note place="margin">105.</note> in all which he ſpeakes. This may appeare to us in theſe foure ſpecials.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the wiſdome thereof: This way of God croſſeth all <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch </seg>1</label> other wayes, and hedges the ſoule out from all ſound comfort by them, only faſtning it upon this.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> As <hi>Paul</hi> cals the Goſpel in this reſpect, the wiſdome of God: caſting downe all thoſe devices of mans wit, wil, works, or wayes, by which fleſh would ſet up a peace and eaſe of all diſtempers to her ſelfe. There is no doubt, but the erranteſt hypocrite living would gladly (if he could) by his ſmoothing with his owne falſe heart, come to a kind of ſetling, that he might no more be troubled: But it is as the ſowing of a new peece to an old garment, and the rent becomes the worſe. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as a ſhort narrow Map of a Shire makes every petty cottingers lands to vaniſh, and cauſes him to account himſelfe a ſtarke beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, lord of a Mole-hill, not worth the owning: So doth this way of God force him, who thought himſelfe no meane man in his Religion and hopes, to ſeeme a ſtarke foole in his owne eyes. For why? hath the Lord revealed the way to life, by the reall death and reſurrection of his onely Sonne, glory being made ſhame, and holineſſe ſinne, and eternity death, to ſatisfie juſtice: and ſhall I play the Mountebank, and thinke to ſatisfie by mine owne trickes and devices? Oh foole, oh beaſt!</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the righteouſneſſe of God: As the Sunne is able <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch </seg>2</label> by his heat to licke up all the dew of the earth, and ſcatter all the miſts of the aire: and the Sea is able to ſwallow up and devoure whatſoever is caſt into it, never to appeare more: Even ſo, the merit of Righteouſneſſe and Sanctification by our Lord Jeſus (compared oft to both theſe in Scripture) is able to licke up and diſpell all the moſt deſperate feares, doubts, and diſtempers of the ſoule. So <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, Whom God ſet forth to be a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation through faith in his bloud, to declare his righteouſnes.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25.</note> What righteouſneſſe? Surely the equalneſſe of pardoning them who are of the faith of Jeſus, becauſe he hath received a full ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: elſe (ſaith he) if he ſhould not juſtifie ſuch an one, he ſhould not be juſt. So full a content hath Chriſt given his Father for ſinne, that if the Father ſhould not acknowledge it ſufficient, he ſhould doe Chriſt wrong, and if he ſhould not impute it to a poore ſoule that beleeves, he ſhould doe the poore ſoule wrong, nay, having freely yeelded his Sonne and received the price, for that very end, he ſhould doe himſelfe infinite wrong, by unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.
<pb n="834" facs="tcp:45715:332"/> But there is no ſuch feare. The Judge of the world will not do unrighteouſly: he will not condemne the righteous and the unbeleever alike. For he hath accepted his Sons death, as a ful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge. If we ſhould receive a ſumme of money for the uſe of an Orphan, and when the Orphan comes of age, ſhould detain it, ſhould he be righteous? Mercy then is of free gift: and faith is a free gift: But juſtification of a poore ſoule for Chriſts merit, is an act of righteouſneſſe. So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.21. Be reconciled to God. Why? Becauſe he hath made him ſinne, who knew none, that we might be Gods righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch </seg>3</label> Thirdly, all other properties of the promiſer, are included in the promiſe, as the truth, faithfulneſſe, mercy, love, (greater then that of the creation) and all the reſt ſcattered in the booke of God, his eternity, and unchangeableneſſe, and the like, are all in the Word: See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.25. with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry others. So that the ſoules doubts and diſtempers may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be caſt upon ſuch promiſes (for ſo the Apoſtle cals them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.) as are built upon ſuch foundations.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch </seg>4</label> Four<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hly, God hath ſtrength in his hand to doe this, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Satan, hell, law, or wrath ſhould ſay to the contrary. I ſay he hath enough to warrant that he hath done, againſt all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers. See <hi>Eſay</hi> 27.4, 5. Anger is not in me: why? Lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſtrength, and make peace. The ſatisfaction of Chriſt, is the ſtrength of mercy, as truly as the law is the ſtrength of ſinne. The arme of mercy is ſo ſtrong, through this, that the ſtrong arme of juſtice cannot pull it away from forgiving a poore ſinner: but mercy will ſtill be above, and will not be beaten downe, but prevaile againſt juſtice, yea triumph againſt judgement. By this ſtrength then which overcomes juſtice, ſhall not the diſtempers of the ſoule much more be vanquiſhed and overcome?</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch </seg>5</label> Laſtly, the intent and purpoſe of God, is by his promiſe, to doe this favour for the ſoule, even to put it out of all doubt and queſtion, and to breed aſſurance in it; <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. That by two things (the word and oath of God) wherein it was impoſſible for God to lie, we might have full aſſurance: and ſo twice more in that Epiſtle he ſpeakes. The meaning whereof is, As ſurely as I from all eternity did intend it, in the foundation of mine electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, my Sonne: as verily as I accepted it at his hands, when he offered it up by his eternall ſpirit, as verily as I offer it to my Church under the word of truth, which cannot lie, and have pawned my Miniſters credit upon it, that, except I ſpeake truely, they are errant diſſemblers; as verily as now my deare Sonne at my right hand in glory, pleads for poore ſoules, that they may partake it; ſo truly and really, without hooke or crooke doe I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſhew them mercy. Why ſhould not every one then that needs it, faſten upon it, and drowne all his diſtempers in it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide all doubts, and reſt well ſatisfied?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Concluſion of reaſons.</note>To theſe I might adde many mo: As, that the promiſe belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, gives the ſoule a full requitall for all which ſhee forgoes: As
<pb n="835" facs="tcp:45715:332"/> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, We have forſaken all, and followed thee Lord, what ſhall we have? Our Saviour anſwers him, An hundred fold here, and after, eternall life. So, perhaps thou haſt forſaken thy old craſie props for Gods word, what ſhalt thou have? Even per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect peace, that which they could never have bred thee. Againe, I might ſay, That faith enlarges the hidebound and ſhrunk heart, and makes it concurre with the Lord, and equall his bowels. I meane, to be enlarged in her bowels toward him againe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before it was not ſo, but ſhe limited the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and reſtrained his compaſſions. Beſides, this word of the promiſe ſets up a light in the heart, above all that light which was there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. We know when it is dark, we are glad of a candle: But when the Sunne ſhines bright, a candle is a poore needleſſe thing, and is drowned by a ſuperiour light: So here, a blind, dark, deluded heart is glad of any dimme candle of its owne, to make it thinke it ſees: but when the word comes, that dimme light vaniſhes. Theſe and many more I might adde: but theſe are ſufficient. I haſten to the queſtion and objection, and the anſwers of them.</p>
               <p>Here then firſt it may be asked,<note place="margin">The Anſwer to a Queſtion.</note> But may a poore ſoule truly loaden with her owne ſinne, and under a condition of a promiſe, be ſubject to ſo many diſtempers? I anſwer, yea ſurely: as in the wombe, the woman that is conceived with child, yet ere the fruit be perfected, feeles abundance of inward griefes, and pains, ſtrugglings and wreſtlings, ere the fruit be come to the full ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: But when it is once come to that, the former diſtempers ceaſe: Even ſo is it here: Till faith have formed the ſoule to a true quietneſſe and ſetling, there cannot chuſe but be many feares and turne-againes, although the ſeed be caſt into the wombe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. But what are theſe? I anſwer,<note place="margin">In three kinds.</note> Such as theſe (I may referre them to theſe three heads for order ſake.) Firſt, erroneous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> on the right hand, proceeding from ſelfe-love, flattering it ſelfe, by her hopes, her morall qualities, her negative abſtinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, opinion of her religious duties, her affections, complaints, her liking of goodneſſe, flaſhes of joy, and the like. Oh! how can ſhe chuſe but doe well? how can ſhe be out of the way? Then muſt thouſands periſh, if ſhe be wrong. She is not ſo ſinfull, that ſhe ſhould put Gods mercy too farre to ſtraine it ſelfe! (Ah poore wretch! thinkeſt thou to fare well by making God leſſe work, or by making thy ſelfe to need him above all ſinners? The Word goes not by thy ſmall ſinne, but by the graciouſneſſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſer) So alſo, of this ſort, are all mixtures of ſelfe, and ſode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings againſt the Word; hoping that ſuch a degree of deſire, or ſorrow, or ſelfe-deniall will ſerve; although it have no roote in the Word, nor continue: Seeking God ſo farre as will hold with ſuch a luſt, liberty, or evill cuſtome; To ſticke to our old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, though we find it craſie by the Word: and to be unwilling to goe any further, and to ſtrippe and bare herſelfe of her owne bottome, that Chriſt might come and take poſſeſsion. But de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately to venture, and caſt all upon hazard, if I be not well,
<pb n="836" facs="tcp:45715:333"/> let all goe, I will take as I find, but I will altar none of my courſe. This for the firſt ſort.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, there are diſtempers on the left hand (for the ſoule is hurried with extremities on both ſides, till ſhe beleeve) I meane with bondage as well as boldneſſe: Of this ſort are all baſe feares, and wicked conceits againſt our ſelves, That we are the unhappieſt of all men, of more averſneſſe to Gods will and way, then any men or women living: That our corruptions are baſer then any: our natures more crooked, inconſtant, awk, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe: that ſuch ſpirits as ours, ſo ſly, ſubtill, and lewd, cannot belong to God: For then ſome reſtraining grace or other would have kept us all this while. (Why oh poore ſoule, is it not as much for the glory of mercy to ſave a crooked ſpirit, as a ſtreight? doſt thou ſo looke upon thine owne ends, that Gods are forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten?) Alſo, a falſe opinion of Gods enmity toward us, becauſe we feele our ſelves as corrupt and hardhearted as ever, little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment in us; but much what the ſame, under long hearing, many mercies, patience, croſſes, meanes of grace: What ſhould this argue, but that our hearts are given over, and left of God? Surely if he had choſen us, we ſhould not be thus. Some there muſt be, after all coſts and trials, who muſt be left in their hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, and none more like to be of that number then ſuch as we feele our ſelves! So tempted to vile thoughts, to lewd luſts and affections: So many backwarder and further off then we (in ſhew) yet have beene brought home to God before us: Many of our time, age, and condition, battered, broken, and humbled, but our hearts remaining as hard as ever, and will not melt: Wee have had more tenderneſſe, then now we have, and if then we could not beleeve, how ſhould we now? We could have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, faſted, mourned, better then now we can, we are now tempted to give over all our hearings, Sacraments: we therefore feare all hope is paſt, we neglected the ſpecial ſeaſon of mercy by our dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, and now it is too late. So much for the ſecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, from this longſomneſſe, and wearineſſe, the ſoule growes to diſquietneſſe of temper, to tedious ſorrowes, bootleſſe afflictings and baskings of it ſelfe, and that by any occaſions of another nature, any accidentall croſſes, melancholy, diſcontent, and wearineſſe of our ſelves, of our lives, wife, children, trade, and converſe with men, conceiting our ſelves to have no right to any of theſe, and therefore they will but encreaſe our judgement: better it were therefore to make a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This alſo for a draught of the third.</p>
               <pb n="837" facs="tcp:45715:333"/>
               <p>Now I ſay for concluſion, the word of Promiſe ſatisfies the ſoule in all reſpects, both leſſer and greater, ſo that now the poore creature is like <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 12. out of his walking ſleepe, when the Angel was gone, and came to ſee that cleerely, which before was as a ſhadow: So the beleeving ſoule by this light of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and by this ſword of the ſpirit diſcovers and cuts off her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyances, here one, there another, as a ſtrong man might cut off theeves aſſaulting him, one by one, at a narrow wicket: And, we might exemplifie all theſe by Scripture, brethren, if time would permit, take one text for all, Thoſe in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> when once God humbled them, and enlightned them, they could cry out, <hi>Aſhur</hi> ſhall not ſave us: we will not ride upon horſes: now we ſee, that with thee the fatherleſſe ſhall find mercy, we will breake off all our falſe hopes, and caſt away our covers of ſhame, and thoſe props of our owne, whereby we hoped to releeve our ſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee, now we will abandon, and renounce them all. A maine place for the proofe hereof. And ſo much for the anſwer of the queſtion.</p>
               <p>Now alſo a doubt here ariſeth, which in a word I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, and then come to the uſe; The queſtion is, If the Word ceaſe all diſtempers, how comes it to paſſe that the Saints are ſo moleſted with them after their beleeving? for, how many doubts and feares, objections, temptations, and luſts, befall the beſt? I anſwer, this will be reſolved by like Scriptures: He that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in me, he that eates of my fleſh, and drinkes of my bloud,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.</note> ſhall hunger nor thirſt no more: How is it then, that our hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger abides all our life? I anſwer. He ſhall hunger no more, deadly, diſtruſtfully, mortally: but hopingly, beleevingly, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly. So here. Theſe diſtempers may now and then ariſe: but not as formerly: then they were generall, reaching to our eſtate: now onely particular, about our actions, our comfort, as ariſing from ignorance, errour, or ſpeciall diſtruſt. Againe, then they came from our owne principle of heart and mind corrupted: but now they proceed from concupiſcence and the remainder of old <hi>Adam</hi> in us, which cannot doe other: Satan alſo incenſing it, and cauſing it to preſent it ſelfe ſo much the more rankly, by how much he feares his owne diſpoſſeſſion; But now, faith our new principle cauſeth an holy Requiem in the ſoule: ſo that it may ſay truly, as he ſpake baſely, Soule, take thine eaſe: Thou haſt goods laid up for many yeares. So I ſay ſome bounſings and clatterings the Devill may cauſe at our doores: but the peace of God which hath calmed all diſtempers before we beleeved, ſhall alſo allay and ſcatter all our miſts of darkneſſe afterward, as they ariſe, and maintaine perfect peace. For why? This is the firſt fruits of that peace which we have in our conſcience, toward God, through juſtification: even as the eares of corne which the Jewes brought to God, was a pledge unto them, that they ſhould have the poſſeſſion of the whole crop. Laſtly, I anſwer, that by this doctrine I meane not that a Chriſtian doth cut off all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
<pb n="838" facs="tcp:45715:334"/> ſo, that whether he beleeve or beleeve not, ſleepe or wake, he is ſure for ever after. No, in no wiſe. But, that ſo long as he holds cloſe to the word, there is power in the word to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that continually, which it effected at the firſt: Chriſt and his promiſe, is Yea and Amen: yeſterday, to day, and the ſame for ever: but how? provided that the ſoule lie ſtill as cloſe to the promiſe to day as yeſterday: that it ſee as much need of it to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell unbeliefe, feares, unquietneſſe this day, as heretofore; and waxe not looſe and preſumptuous, which is the way to expoſe the ſoule to temptations, or elſe to nuzzle it up in a rotten quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me which will breake out againe after. But as we ſay to a Tradeſman, or others, Keepe your ſhop well, and that will keepe you: neglect it, and that will give over you: ſo here, Tend the promiſe, and you ſhall find ſufficient in it, to uphold you in peace, and to keepe off thoſe flies of Beelzebub, which were wont to annoy you: But if you ceaſe your worke, wonder not if your diſtempers returne: for (although there were no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies without to moleſt) there is enough from within a baſe heart, to create pudder and unſettledneſſe to the ſoule. And ſo much for the Anſwer alſo to this Queſtion. Now I come to ſome uſe: and indeed, the uſe is very weighty and manifold.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>2</label> Secondly, this doctrine may give us a good Receit againſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.<note place="margin">Inſtruct.</note> A diſeaſe which every man cries out of, but few know how to heale, and fewer apply the remedy. Some tell us, Melancholy will have her courſe when all is done: the beſt cure is, to be patient, till the fewell be ſpent. Others tell us, we muſt be merry and cheerefull: as if a man ſhould bidde a man whoſe legges are cut off, to goe of his errand. Others make ſhort work of it, and thinke nothing but riddance of their lives will ridde them of it. I doe not now ſpeake of the meere bodily humour, I leave that to the Phyſitians Art: I meane ſuch accidentall Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly as befals men from the ſadde reflecting of their condition upon their owne thoughts, till they have brought themſelves into a maze of confuſion. Whither this ſorrow be carnall, or godly, either indirectly cauſed by ſuch diſeaſedneſſe of body, weakneſſe of conſtitution, loſſes, reproach, as beginnes to worke the heart
<pb n="839" facs="tcp:45715:334"/> to a conceit of Gods diſpleaſure: or ſuch depth of Melancholy as ariſeth from a long and unprofitable ſtruggling with our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall diſeaſes, without finding any iſſue. The beſt cure of both theſe, is by faith in the promiſes. That onely (like that ſword of <hi>Alexander</hi>) can cut the Gordian knot in pieces at once, without picking it out. Men ſpend themſelves infinitely about the thought of theſe ſadde dyſaſters, and what may come of them, how miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a plight and pickle they have brought themſelves into: As if a man fallen into a deepe Well, ſhould cry out and tell folke a long tale how he fell in: but ſtill lie there, and deſire no man to hale him out. But the beſt remedy is, to cure one contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by another. Guilt and feare, an unquiet conſcience, is that which cauſeth thy Melancholy: All is not as thou wouldeſt have it, thou feeleſt not thy ſelfe as thou wouldſt be: Why? what wouldſt thou be? merry, cheerefull, a free man, ridde of thy chaines: Well: goe to that which onely can eaſe the ſoule of all her diſtempers: that is, get the promiſe of Chriſt, grounded upon the ſtrength of the ſatisfaction: beſtow thy plodding thoughts upon a new ſubject: ſay thus to thy ſelfe, Did God indeed of his owne accord cut off his owne quarrell, when he might have deſtroy'd me in a moment? Hath he appointed his owne juſtice a ranſome, that he might have ſtrength to reſiſt and diſanull it? Doth he offer his bare breaſt and heart of love to be ſeen by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poore ſoule that is in ſtraits for want of it, and knowes not whither to turne it ſelfe? Doth he bidde ſuch a ſoule drowne all her guilt and feares, in this free and full good pleaſure of his, to be reconciled with her? May ſhe beleeve, that the requiring of this price of his owne Sonne, will ridde the ſoule of her debt, and diſcharge her of it? Set thine heart then deeply upon this meditation: pray God to turne it off from the ill cuſtome of thy diſtempered thoughts, and noyſome feares that poſſeſſe thee: And if thou canſt but obtaine this grace to divert them thus, I ſay unto thee, That through Gods goodneſſe, a quarter of that needleſſe and diſtreſſed plodding of thy miſery might drowne thy diſtempers in the bottome of the Sea, and turne thy Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly into freedome and joy. For why? ſo ſaith my doctrine, Truſting to the Word, will ridde the ſoule of all her diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this point ſtrongly confuteth that Popiſh tenet, That <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>3</label> no man can come to know himſelfe certainly to be in the ſtate of grace and favour with God: but we muſt alway be in doubt,<note place="margin">Confut.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene hope and feare, and that's the beſt way (they ſay) to hold us well occupied, to keepe us in a wholſome awe and feare of our corruptions, and to exerciſe us in the practice of repentance. But as for this faith to ridde us of our diſtempers, that they call a fancie, and that a dangerous one, as provoking a man to looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and preſumption. But, (O yee hypocrites) dare you thus diſhonour that bleſſed truth of God (built upon ſuch ſtrong foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations) as to detract from it the maine prerogative of ſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="840" facs="tcp:45715:335"/> the conſcience? Shall the Promiſe have no more power in it, than the vaine and carnall preſumption of an unſound heart? Shall both alike leave the ſoule in ſtaggering? Farre be it from us to yeeld ſo prophane an abſurdity. As for your revelations, which you ſay have beene given to ſome ſpeciall Saints of God, to aſſure them of heaven: although wee grant, that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had greater meaſure of aſſurance, and more than ordinary freedome from theſe diſtempers, yet we affirme that the evidence which they had, came from no other revelation, than that which the Word breedeth by the the concurrence of the Spirit, which is no other than faith: and as for that greater meaſure of full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Spirit, it was wrought in them by the promiſe and faith receiving the ſame: for the Spirit, although it be above the Word (ſimply conſidered) yet it is not without the Word. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that Spirit ſo peculiar a thing as is onely given to ſpeciall men: but even to ſome of all ſorts of beleevers, even ſo many as it pleaſes God to ſtabliſh after they have long clave to the truth and faithfulneſſe of the promiſer. So <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>By whom</hi> (the Spirit) <hi>you were ſealed after yee had beleeved.</hi> But to leave theſe deafe Adders, who will not be charmed: what ſhould it need to trouble us to heare them ſpeake againſt the power and authority of the Word, who (if the Word ſhould prevaile) muſt forfeit their Kingdome of Traditions &amp; unwritten verities, wherewith they embondage the pretious ſoules of them whom Chriſt hath redeemed? This Word of God (which they ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly declaime againſt) being that eternall truth which ſhall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive all their inventions: and that breath of the mouth of God which ſhall one day conſume, whatſoever hath ſet up it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the comfort of a poore ſoule, and the glory of the riches of Grace. Meane time we abandon this their conceit, as the moſt horrible cut-throat of the Conſcience, and the greateſt tyranny in the world: to wit, That a doubting and diſtempered creature, wofully tired with her eſtate, muſt be compelled to returne to her old miſery, with an encreaſe of her bondage worſe than E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian.</p>

And although there were but three ſaved, they claime to be of that number; no man ſhall beat them off. But as <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul,</hi> when he pretended he had obeyed the command of God, <hi>Whence then is the bleating of theſe ſheep, and lowing of theſe oxen?</hi> So ſay I to theſe, if you have beleeved the Word of God indeed, whence are thoſe privie nips of your conſcience, which do ſo continually aſſault you? Whence are thoſe terrours of heart, with which many of you are met with, when you would

When you are in the middeſt of your eaſe and jollity, your liberties, your ſports and pleaſures, whence come thoſe cold qualmes over your baſe ſpirits, barring you out from peace and faſtning terrours upon you, ſtronger then you can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt?

                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.30.</note> If they whom the Sonne hath freed, are free indeed, whence is your ſlavery? No, no, you do but ſet a good face on it; you make faire weather outwardly, but hatch inwardly ſuch a viper, as will fret your bowels, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy you: it is one thing to ſmother and choake your feares, and beare downe your diſtempers; another to drowne them in the ſea of the promiſe: you have other delights to fill your hearts withall: the Lord would have ſet on the worke of the law more throughly, and made you more to ſtinke in your owne noſtrils, and to prize the Word of God, and the promiſe of eaſe, if ever you had beene truly loaden; But ſithence you would have both your luſts, and the promiſe too, holding a wolfe by the eares, which you are loath to forgoe, and yet cannot well keep, know, that you deceive your ſelves in boaſting that you hold cloſe to the promiſe: for they that do ſo, may loſe their diſtempers therein, which you keepe ſtill. It is true, That the Lord would have all his (as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith) count it their ſtrength to ſit ſtill: But how? not in a chaire of eaſe, pretending a freedome which you never had, and favouring your ſelves in any forbidden vanities of your owne envie, luſt, pride, revenge, and the like. But the ſtrength of a poore ſoule, is to ſit ſtill in reſpect of her cavillings, and fightings againſt the truth of the promiſe. Perhaps you will ſay, you do ſo, and feele no ſuch matter in your ſelves, but are quiet and ſecure. But I anſwer, your peace is not ſound, there is a crack in it, as appeares by this, That you walke not as Gods free-men do: you are as cloſe to God in your love, in your ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, in your humble carriage, as you would pretend to be in your beleeving. No man can palpably diſcerne the Devils chaines upon the Lords free-men. Wherefore to conclude, I ſay to you, as he to that meſſenger, <hi>What haſt thou to do with peace? turne thee behind mee.</hi> Oh, theſe are the daies wherein the moſt vile and preſumptuous hypocrites catch at a promiſe, and beare downe their conſciences! But be not thou (O Chriſtian friend) like to them, for their &amp; diſeaſe wound is but healed deceitfully, and ſhall breake out againe moſt deadly, when they ſhall not be able to reſiſt it, except it pleaſe the Lord to ſend them, upon better conditions, to claime the promiſe. So much ſhall ſerve for this Uſe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, this bitter reproofe of all ſuch, who (in the judgement <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>5</label> of Charity) do beleeve and cleave to the Word, yet will not be drawne from the bad cuſtome of their former doubts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and diſtempers; but ſuffer Beelzebub ſtill to light upon their ſore, and to moleſt them, and gall them ſtill. Oh! what
<pb n="842" facs="tcp:45715:336"/> a diſhonour is this to the promiſe of God? ſtill to hold a ſecret correſpondence with Satan, and to nouriſh our old picking of knots, and anſwering of feares by our owne blanching wit and deviſes, yea ſpending houres and daies weariſomely in ſetting our owne wit and invention on worke to beat off our objections; and thinking they have done themſelves good ſervice in the meane while. Whence comes this? ſurely by your weakneſſe, and relapſing from your former hold of the promiſe: This ſelf-wit and will, is ſo naturall, that we are prone and propenſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt and roll backe unto it, as faſt as the Lord ſeems to ſettle us by his Word: it is an inbred evill, alway fighting againſt the law of faith: as it is eaſie for a woman to go to a pond or pulke ſtanding neere to her doore (though the water be not ſo good) rather then to goe to a fountaine of living water further off: Eaſe and ill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome are inchanting enemies: But remember, that onely that blood of ſprinkling hath in it a ſure bottome of ſtaying feares, ſo that the ſoule may be quiet from the deſtroying Angell, and the out-cries of Egypt: Could they (who never had the experience of ſuch a thing before) yet ſo confidently venture their lives upon the Word: and ſhall ſuch as have (in likelihood) approved this promiſe of God by experience, and ventured themſelves upon it, and felt it a ſoveraigne remedy againſt their diſtempers, returne to tread the maze of their old confuſed thoughts the ſecond time? As if the Word had ſuddenly loſt her ſtrength and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to ſuſtaine them as formerly? Shall forgetfulneſſe, melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, temptation, corruption, ill cuſtome, be able to pull them from an aſſured hold of reſt, to aſſured vexation and diſtemper? I ſpeake it (brethren) upon knowledge: It hath beene thus, and is thus with many, through a weariſomeneſſe of this ſpirituall trade of beleeving; that men grow into a very falling ſickneſſe in this kind, that is, ſuch a cuſtome of wofull doubtfulneſſe, and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that they ſeem to delight in it. Alas poore ſoule! doſt thou thinke that to be preſumption in thee which the Lord himſelfe calls confidence? or becauſe, perhaps, thou feeleſt the dregs of a bold heart, ſtill abiding in thee, haſt thou no other way to avoid a ſhallow, ſave by running into a gulfe? If the Lord be willing thou ſhouldſt hold thy peace upon the naked termes of his offer and promiſe, ſeemes it too good for thee? or if it be, muſt thou needes undervalue his grace by thy baſeneſſe, as if it were too great for him to beſtow, becauſe it is too good for thee to enjoy? Know it, from the ground of this doctrine, the Lord delights as little in this practiſe of thine, as thou ſeemeſt to delight much in it. And although I deny not, but in reſpect of thy weakneſſe, there may be ſome place for pity, yet there is more cauſe of ſharpe reproofe: For why? Didſt thou never beleeve the Word? deceive thy ſelfe no longer, and put away thy diſtruſt from thee. But haſt thou beleeved? (for ſo thou didſt pretend) then truſt the Lord ſtill, and ſay with him, Why doſt thou thus fret (O my ſoule) in my breaſt and recoyle againſt that which hath former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="843" facs="tcp:45715:336"/> ſatisfied thee? Turne rather thy vexation into prayer, and ſay, Remove theſe unpleaſing chaines (Lord) at laſt, and ſet mee at liberty: ſhew me this wiſedome from above, not onely barely to cling to it, but alſo to improve it ſo, as to feele the power of it, to ſhut out my baſe diſtempers out of doores, and there to hold them out roughly, by the advantage which I have gotten by thy Word. Let not the blind and the lame come any more at the City of <hi>David,</hi> it is no place for them. As thy Word prevailes, ſo let doubts and diſtempers ceaſe, and hold this ſea of my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled heart in that calmeneſſe which thine owne voyce once cauſed when thou rebukedſt the waves thereof. So much for this.</p>

For as it is in the graffing of a ſien into the ſtocke, if any thing fall into the cleft of the ſtocke, which holds off the ſien from cleaving cloſe to the ſtocke, thereby it comes to paſſe, that the ſap of the ſtocke comes not at the ſien to nouriſh it: and ſo in ſtead of growing one with the ſtocke, it is ſeparated therefrom, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers away: ſo is it here. Whatſoever it be that keeps off the ſoule from claſping to the Promiſe, let us ſtudiouſly caſt it out, leſt the ſoule returne to her old diſtempers, and communicate not of the ſap and virtue of it, to ſuſtaine her in hope and comfort. Who would loſe his labour in ſo weighty a caſe as the returning back of ſuch an enemy? Who would not be at any coſt to be rid of it? We have a common ſpeech, That a man muſt make a ſilver bridge for an enemy to eſcape away, on condition wee may be troubled with him no more: So if God will chaſe away our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, and help us to beat them downe from flying (like bees) about our eares, let us be at ſome coſt to furniſh our ſelves with ſound faith in the Promiſe. And whatſoever it be that might keepe the heart away, and cauſe it to lye looſe to the promiſe, let us be aware of it, and abhorre it. Here ſome may aske, What are the uſuall lets of this grace of faith, from comming into the ſoule? <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will mention ſome few of them,<note place="margin">Lets of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</note> before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the uſe. The firſt is Mindleſneſſe, and Heedleſneſſe of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Promiſe: we count it not as it is; a large thing, but as a ſtrange thing. Nay it were well if we beheld it ſo, for ſtrange things are beheld with ſtudiouſneſſe. But rather, as a ſlight common mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Get we therefore ſound judgement of this Medicine, and judge of it, as a thing which will worke wonders. Wee ſhould magnifie it (in this reſpect) in our owne eyes: it is ſaid that the Lord magnified <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> when as at their word the Sea and Jordan went backward, and became a wall on both ſides of them, that they might goe over dry-ſhod. If the mouth of a Promiſe be ſo honourable, what is the word of the Eternal God?
<pb n="844" facs="tcp:45715:337"/> If the feet of them be beautifull that utter it, what then is the meſſage? If Heathens would ſo beautifie theſe Idols which they worſhipped, the better to draw their affections, how ſhould wee ſet up the Promiſe, as worthy our beleeving? Truly I may compare it to many things. It is like <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſpeech to the Iſraelites, <hi>Stand ſtill and behold the ſalvation of God, for thoſe Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians which you ſee this day to purſue you, you ſhall never ſee more.</hi> Oh! if the Promiſe were ſo beheld by us, as the arme of Gods power able to drowne all our diſtempers, as in a ſea, that wee might never ſee them more: What a bleſſed ſight were it? Behold it then (as they did) and take good marke of it, as a thing not to be ſlighted over. So it is ſaid of our Saviour; that his word rebuked the ſea, and her waves, ſo that there was a great calme. And the people were amazed at it, ſaying, <hi>Who is this, that even the ſea, and the tempeſts obey him?</hi> So ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ld we be aſtoniſh't to thinke of the power of a promiſe, ſaying, what ſpeciall thing is it, that turnes ſuch diſtempers of ſpirit into ſuch a calme? Its like to the hands of <hi>Ananias:</hi> which being laid upon <hi>Paul,</hi> cauſed the ſcales to fall off his eyes: So ſhould the promiſe cauſe thy ſcales of errours, thy feares, thy qualmes and diſtempers to vaniſh. Behold it as a rare medicine which hath cauſed all the feares of the people of God to ceaſe,<note place="margin">Act.</note> and to turne to ſweet eaſe: <hi>Davids, Hezekia's, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah's, Pauls,</hi> theirs of Samaria at <hi>Philips</hi> preaching. Its like to <hi>Peters</hi> preaching to that ſame City, at the beleeving whereof the inchanmtents and deluſions (wherewith before the whole city was gulled) became as ſmoake in the aire. Its like a certaine Court-Lady, called <hi>Jane Make-peace,</hi> of whom in the ancient Engliſh Chronicle its recorded, that ſhee was of ſo ſweet and amiable a nature, that whatſoever quarrell fell out in the Kings Court among the Nobles, or in the Family, ſhe preſently tooke it up, and made all quiet. This is truly the Lady <hi>Make-peace</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and the ſoule, diſpelling all doubts of conſcience, and making it quiet againe. Do we take her to be ſo, and ſet by her, and is ſhe ſo beloved, and bleſſed a thing in our ſoules as that Lady was among all the Courtiers. Surely then her worth would procure honour and eſteeme from us: and we ſhould not paſſe by the promiſe ſo ſlightly as wee doe. Our giggiſh heads have not the gift to obſerve a Promiſe: we are as <hi>Naaman,</hi> ſo full of his crotchets, ſo looking another way, that his ſervants are here faine to tell him of it, and ſay, Father, thinke better of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets words, do not ſlight them over ſo. Verily, till this be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that the Truths of God beare eminent note in our eye, there is ſmall hope of doing us good. Wee heare twenty Sermons of Promiſes, ere our eye be turn'd the right way. They are as beames, and we make them but as moles. Get we bookes of promiſes, and turne our eye off, the whiles from other objects, that theſe may be dwelt upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond is Forgetfulneſſe. Wee digeſt not the promiſe, when as we have once obſerved it. Wee ſuffer it to leake out as
<pb n="845" facs="tcp:45715:337"/> water by the chinkes of a veſſell. It becomes as meat to an ill habited ſtomach, which regorges it as faſt as it receives it, and ſtayes not till it be altered. Many pageants wee will looke at for the pleaſantneſſe of them, which yet we inſtantly paſſe over. But the Promiſe doth us no good, nor can eaſe us of our diſtempers, till it abide in us. Our Saviour oft preſſeth this, If my Word abide in you, you ſhall be my Diſciples. Let the Word dwell (<hi>Col.</hi> 3.) As the miſers cheſt and coffers is fraught with gold and pearles, ſo ſhould the ſoule of a good man with the promiſes, it ſhould be his Treaſure. Pondering of the Promiſes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.</note> is as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the ſeed, which cauſes the wombe to conceive. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and weighing of the promiſe, is as the cleane beaſts chewing of the end, till it be almoſt made milke. We are weary of the promiſe, as they of Manna; our ſoule loathes this dry Manna. But as the Lord ſhames them for that, by ſhewing how many wayes Manna might be dreſſed, baked, fryed, parched, it was good any way: ſo may I ſhame us: the promiſe may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up as a cup by many handles, and that fitly: whether we thinke of it, as the fruit of Gods decree to ſave, or of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus his death (in which it is ratified:) or in the Fathers acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: or in the Miniſters fidelity: or in the Lords prevention of us, the wiſedome, and other properties even now named: or our owne deſolation without it: or the Saints generall claſping about it: or the univerſall ignorance, unacquaintance of the world with ſo ſpirituall a ſubject: ſurely, every way wee might heale this diſeaſe of our little muſing of it. But above all, if the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from all our old diſtempers, did preſent it ſelfe to our minds: How do men plod upon Purchaſes, Pleaſures, Honours, becauſe thereby they imagine that they ſhall become new men, and that they ſhall live no longer as they have done, baſely, poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, mopiſhly? So ſhould the new happy life of faith (no more to lead a ſad, diſmall life) affect us. <hi>Nineveh</hi> could turne her thoughts from plodding feares, and look up ſaying,<note place="margin">

And are wee ſo farre from faſtning theſe cords of direct promiſes, about our armeholes? It is a harſh worke to the fleſh, but ſweet to the ſpirit: and although the gains be ſlow, yet if they be kept together they will make a heavy purſe; when as the neglect of this work wil leave the ſoule beggerly, &amp; to her ſhifts. Therfore wait upon thoſe doores, &amp; at thoſe poſts of Aſſemblies, upon which the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Heaven are fixed, &amp; think thy ſelf ſafe when thoſe nayles given by the Maſter of them, are driven faſt to ſticke in thy ſoule, that they may not eaſily be unſettled. So much for the ſecond.</p>
               <p>The third is eſtranging of our hearts from the promiſe, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> growing out of acquaintance with it: ſo that we grow not more and more into a promiſe, to know the worth and ſweetneſſe thereof. Contrary to this is the welcomming and entertaining of the Promiſe. The which phraſe the Apoſtle uſes in that place
<pb n="846" facs="tcp:45715:338"/> of <hi>Timothy, This is a faithfull ſaying, and worthy all entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> the word there is taken from Inne-keepers who ſtand at their doores or gates of receit,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.</note> with both armes to welcome and lodge travellers. Such a traveller the Promiſe is: going up and downe ſeeking where it may be entertained. Juſt it is with God to hold us to hard meat (brethren) and to ſtraiten us in this point, and I pray God it be not the lot of this place to be bereft of this traveller, for theſe forty years hath he gone up and downe among us, ſeeking who are good hoaſts, and finding few: And becauſe the Lord hath pind his promiſes upon our ſleeves a great while, wee waxe ſhie of them, and thinke we may have too much of them. But woe unto us if thoſe pathes which have beene trodden bare by the feet of the Meſſengers of God, become overgrowne, and lye unoccupied, as ſhe ſpeakes <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. for want of travell: I tell you, good gueſts finding bad hoaſts are grieved, and ſoone ſeeke them places of better reſort and welcome. So many as have received him among us, have loſt nothing, ſave our diſtempers and corruptions, which we were clogg'd with, for this gueſt brings glad tidings, and expels all ſorrowes and old in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates which diſtempered the ſoule. Let us therefore beware of this unhoſpitalneſſe, and grow glad entertainers of this gueſt, the beſt which ever came within our doores. Grow we as familiar and entire with the promiſes, as the world is ſtrange and aloofe from them. Elſe our uſuall diſtempers will be ſure to haunt us, whole mornings, dayes, and nights, while they have tyred us; But if the Promiſes be preſent, and our doore ſtand ever open for them to enter, and loath to leave them, our old crochets will have ſmall joy to ſalute us, their roome will be better then their company. The ſoule is carried along with deluſions of ſelfe, and moleſted either by falſe feares, or falſe hopes, as we read of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſera's</hi> mother and her Ladies, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">

But then ſhe thought his charet wheeles ſtaid too long: thus was ſhe willing to beare her ſelfe in hand with the beſt, both ſhe and her falſe Ladies, till the worſt affronted her.

Our old gueſts have the birthright, and long have taken up the roome: it will coſt time to diſlodge them againe: Therefore (to end this) let us (if we would ſhunne the ſurfet of our old diſtempers) grow inward with the promiſe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 28. <hi>Eſay</hi> 38.</note> and as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, let us acquaint our ſelves with God; Till he come and ſay, This is your refreſhing, to give over your owne torrents and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtreames, and to embrace the waters of <hi>Siloe,</hi> which runne ſoftly: let us make the promiſe our Companion, let it be both of our Court and counſell, let us empty all our mind into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome thereof, and hide nothing from it, let us diſcover all our doubts and diſtempers unto it: for it hath (as <hi>Salom.</hi> is ſaid to have) the wiſdome and treaſures of God, to ſupply us: Marke it, a Miniſter of the promiſes is as a ſcare-crow to the people, they care not how little they acquaint with him: And as ſcarce one of forty knowes a Miniſter or a Prophet in the name of one: ſo few know or receive a promiſe in the name of a promiſe: much leſſe doe they make toward it,<note place="margin">

               <p>To haſten, another let is unconvincedneſſe of heart by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. A fearfull ſinne: when men will not admit the Word to prevaile ſo farre with them, as to debate the matter ſeriouſly with themſelves, till it have left a convincing evidence behind it that their eſtate is warrantable: But ſuffer themſelves to dance in a net, and to lie in an ambiguous and doubtfull ſuſpence, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, when by taking paines and laying themſelves in the ballance of the Sanctuary, they might find themſelves either not to have to doe with the promiſe, and ſo amend their defects: or elſe to be thoſe to whom the promiſe pertaines, and ſo reſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and ſet their hearts at reſt, as convinced that it is theirs. Oh! it's a diſeaſe ſo naturall unto us, that it is hardly rooted out, <hi>viz.</hi> to pleaſe our ſelves with the conceit that all is well, and our diſtempers ſhall ceaſe: but not to try our ſelves till wee bee convinced. Give me leave to tell you (brethren) this dallying with a promiſe, and not going through-ſtitch, will breed you ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the end. Not long ſince, the report of a ſtrange accident came to mine eares, of a certaine Gentleman who was in love with a Virgin of good ranke, to whom he had long made love, and thinking all cock-ſure, becauſe ſhe made very faire corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence toward him, he beganne to pleaſe himſelfe in his fond humour, and gave himſelfe ſuch content in his hopes (without any ſadde enquiry of her finall conſent to marry him, which might eaſily have beene had, if he had followed it) that he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, as one that might have her at his command. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman perceiving that he did not carry himſelfe throughly in the buſineſſe, nor as one that reſolved to come to an iſſue, ſet her
<pb n="848" facs="tcp:45715:339"/> heart upon another lover, of more ardent affection and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſage being brought to the Gentleman, as he was playing upon his Lute, ſo ſmote him, that he daſhing his Lute, and breaking it into fitters, forthwith went out of his right wits. The promiſe is like to this Virgin: ſhe ſerves to be married really, and not alway to be dallied with. She loves that the ſoule ſhould make towards her with affection; but when the ſeaſon is come, that the bargaine ſhould be made up, and that the ſoule be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of her good will to marry it, ſhe cannot endure any dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance or paltring. If then the ſeaſon be neglected, and the ſoule grow to take things for granted, without any ſerious triall and concluſion, ſhe turnes another way, and enclines to marry one who will beſtow more hearty love upon her. Beware (good brethren) of this dalliance: they who deſire to be eaſed of the diſtempers of the ſingle eſtate, and to live in a ſetled courſe, muſt wiſely take the opportunity and ſeaſon which God offers, and embrace it: leſt after, their ſorrowes returne double and treble, and when they would faine proceed, it be denied them. We ſee ſingle perſons withſtanding good offers, lie by unregarded, till they repent them. Men love a ſtaggering courſe: whereas, when they feele their neceſſities to pinch them, and to ſend them to God for eaſe; and not ſo onely, but the Lord reveales the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with a great deale of ſweetneſſe and delight to them, ſo that their hearts grow very farre in love with it, prize it, and thinke no paines or coſt too great for it: then ought they to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the ſeaſon of the Sonne of man, and to apply themſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and ſadly to take the opportunity. Then ſhould they come to a point with the Lord, and with all humbleneſſe and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſay thus, O Lord thou haſt ſaid, that a loaden wretch ſhall find eaſe in thee, a fatherleſſe creature left and forſaken of all proppes, ſhall find m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rcy with thee: If I deny that thou haſt made me ſuch an one, I ſhould lie, for I lie under a burden intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and the hearſay of thine eaſe hath drawne me after it, with an unfeigned, reſtleſſe, and hungry heart: therefore what more can be ſaid, but it is of thee, that I am the party? What have I to ſay to the contrary? Thy truth is without hooke or crooke: none more needing; none ſuch a ſinner as I; none ſo faithfull as thou, none ſuch a God as thou, to pardon and ſubdue ſinne: Thou haſt therefore done this (O Lord) as I conceive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy meaning is to ſave me, and bind mine heart for ever to thee: I can neither ſay more nor leſſe, but it is from the Lord, and if he will doe it, what is freer then his gift, or ſtronger then his will? I am content that my will be borne downe by it, and bee as one bound, both hands and feete, unable to reſiſt. Thus the ſoule which deſires to come to an iſſue with God, diſcourſes from point to point with it ſelfe, till it grow convinced: Even as <hi>Judah</hi> ſeeing the cloak, ſignet, and ſtaffe brought forth, acknowledged how the caſe ſtood, and yeelded. And <hi>Haman</hi> hearing that ſuch and ſuch an intent the King had to honour a favorite, by and by
<pb n="849" facs="tcp:45715:339"/> laying things together grew to thinke, Whom would the King ſooner honour then my ſelfe? That which he weakly, and from the mutable favour of a man (whoſe breath is in his noſtrils) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded erroneouſly; that doe thou gather infallibly from the mouth of a God, whoſe love is unchangeable, and ſo let thy ſoule be at quiet, as <hi>Rebecca's</hi> was, when it was agreed upon, that ſhe ſhould marry <hi>Iſaac,</hi> there was no dallying admitted, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and undelayingly ſhe goes to him, and becomes his wife. Oh brethren! we are making the match off and on, all our life long, ſtill asking, ſhall I, and ſhall I? Oh I could beteame it! and never come to an end: and thereby, come infinitely ſhort of that comfort of our union and fellowſhip with God, which elſe might be enjoyed. To end therefore, let us no more conſult with our owne baſe, dallying, laſie ſpirits, but begge that ſpirit which onely can convince the ſoule of righteouſneſſe, and never lin, till our gadding and vaine hearts be ballanced and perſwaded to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle once for adoe upon the promiſe,<note place="margin">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage given them to caſt the hardeſt. Brethren, I feare many of us, were never in <hi>Naamans</hi> caſe. Doe but a little conſider of it. The caſe with him, ſtood juſt as ours doth. <hi>Naaman</hi> here hath an incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſeaſe: which none can heale, in all the world, ſave one man: He comes to him, craves a cure: receives anſwer, <hi>Go waſh:</hi> The meſſage pleaſes him not: he frets and ſtampes, that it is no eaſier, no more liking to his humour: hereupon (more looking at his humour then this diſeaſe) he is ready to fling away in a rage. His ſervants come about him, and tell him, Maſter, if thy diſeaſe might be otherwiſe cured, it skill'd not greatly to turne homeward: but the matter is conſiderable, here we are, on the one ſide pinched with a leproſie incurable, on the other, offered a remedy that likes us not: in this caſe either we muſt reject it, and ſo we are ſure to keepe our diſeaſe, or we muſt accept the remedy; What ſhall we here doe? Thou ſayeſt the remedy is unlike, uncertaine be it ſo, but the leaving it is aſſured and deſperate miſery. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the two ſhall we take? Shall we preferre certaine ſorrow to uncertaine good? What folly were that? Perhaps we may goe to <hi>Jordan,</hi> and come back as we came: grant it: it is but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure: for perhaps we may ſpeed: If we ſpeed by going, we are made: if we ſpeed not, we are not undone, we ſhall come backe no worſe then we went. Therefore there is three to one, for our going: let us deny our tech, our conceit, and diſtemper, let us but venture it, and caſt the worſt: but home (in any caſe) let us not goe, without trying the remedy. Hereupon he adventures, and finds it as the Prophet foretels. Juſt ſo is it with a poore
<pb n="850" facs="tcp:45715:340"/> ſoule. Feare on the one ſide, leſt God his word ſhould deceive it, doth diſmay it from attempting the promiſe: on the other ſide, hope to ſpeed doth encourage us: What ſhall we doe? Surely, let the poſſibility of ſpeeding, the deſperate impoſſibility of ſpeeding any other way, and, that our venturing cannot make us in worſe caſe then we were, (it may make us in much better) prevaile with us: If we muſt be miſerable, let us fall into the hands of God; if we muſt periſh, better that his hand caſt us away, then our owne diſtruſt: if he can be unfaithfull, well may we be miſerable (for our owne guilt, and not his unfaithfulneſſe hath made us ſo:) Therefore, how ever it be, let us venture our ſelves rather upon a poſſible hope, then lie ſtill in aſſured miſery. This is the very ſtate of it: and by this we may ſee what the wofull condition of an unbeleever is: He doth as <hi>Naaman</hi> would have done, (if God had given him his will) he chuſeth to lie under his load, as the Aſſe in her ſlow, without ſtriving to get out: nay, preferreth a ſullen humour of diſcontent, before the adventuring upon Gods way: that is to ſay, aſſured miſery, before poſſible remedy. In other caſes,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.</note> no man will be ſo fooliſh. Take an inſtance. In the great famine of <hi>Samaria,</hi> there ſate two Lepers at the gate, of all others moſt ſure to ſtarve: It comes into their minds, that their caſe was deſperate: and that any termes were to bee cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen before dying in coole bloud: Let us (ſay they) go offer our ſelves to the Campe of our enemies: if they ſave our lives, we ſhall live; if not, we are but dead men: we were better be ſlaine out-right then die here. Hereupon they ventured, and lighted well. Conſider we well of this: Shall fleſh and bloud in a caſe of life and death, venture upon a poſſibility, rather then lie ſtill in aſſured miſery; venture without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: nay venture upon an enemy? And ſhall we be ſo baſe, and cowardly in the caſe of our immortall ſoules, as to chuſe rather to periſh where we lie, then to venture our ſelves upon a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full promiſe, upon no enemy, but a Father, who aſſures us that we ſhall not onely not be worſe then we were, but happy and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given? Who ſhould be ſo foole-hardy, but one that was never put to throughly, in the ſenſe of his unavoidable miſery? If the party purſued by the avenger of bloud, ſhould (having advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ground of the purſuer) wilfully have lien downe in the mid-way, ſaying, I ſhall never get thither, I were as good lie ſtill for naught, as goe for naught, would not any man have thought him a ſenſeleſſe blocke, not affected with his danger? Therefore (to end this) ſeeing there is that in the promiſe, which can reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy us, let us make toward it: and if our baſe ſpirits miſgive us in the entrance, as not knowing the ſucceſſe, yet let our inward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe thruſt us forward, and tell us, This is no time of quarrelling with God, and keeping of our miſery ſtill, but rather of ſeeking out: worſe we cannot be, better we may be: let us therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre hope before ruine, and ſay, If I muſt needs periſh, I will periſh by venturing, not by cowardize. So much for the fifth.</p>

               <p>And to conclude, by theſe meanes, let us reſigne up our ſelves to the authority and power of the promiſe, which hath as infinite a ſupply of helpe from a fountaine of grace to anſwer our doubts and cavils as we have of objections to diſcourage our ſelves: And, the rather becauſe it is eternall, to ſurvive all our tedious and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe cavils: Let us claſpe and cleave to this promiſe, as having grounds enough (from the manifold excellencies therein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) to match our feares: let us conſent to the offer of it, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the command of it: let us ſet to our ſeale, that it is true, not onely in it ſelfe, but alſo to us, for our remedy: let us be carried into the ſtreame of it, as being able to turne our ſtreame a quite contrary way: let us lot upon it, ſet up our reſt in it, buy and ſell upon it, as the thing we make full reckoning and account to be happy by: yea, let us plead it, when our neceſsities, carnall hearts, doubts and feares doe put us to it, as thoſe who will not eaſily forgoe their right in it: and ſo hold it, as that which the Lord our God hath beſtowed upon us,<note place="margin">Iudg.</note> and therefore (as <hi>Iphta</hi> once ſaid) we will poſſeſſe it, and not be beaten off from it, whatſoever any enemy can ſay to weaken it. Thus much for this Uſe of Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notion may ſerve.</p>
               <p>The next is Uſe of Exhortation<note place="margin">Exhortation.</note> to all ſuch as either doe deſire <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>6</label> to feele:<note place="margin">In 2 Branches.</note> or ſuch as have felt this benefit by the promiſe already to free them from their diſtempers. The former to refuſe no pains to get faith: the latter both to bleſſe God for that liberty, yea to truſt him for the true peace of Conſcience iſſuing from faith: and alſo to rely upon the promiſe for a riddance from all future diſtempers which may ariſe from revolts, temptations, or croſſes, throughout their courſe.</p>
               <p>Let me ſpeake a word of both. For the firſt, let every poore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſoule be encouraged to breake through all difficulties, hindring the ſoule from beleeving, becauſe the fruit recompenceth the coſt. I remember, how one of the poore Martyrs encouraged his fellow (the one being a blind man, and the other a lame) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſtake, Be of good cheere (ſaith the one to the other) we have a ſharpe breakfaſt, but we ſhall have a ſweete ſupper: my Lord of <hi>London (Boner)</hi> ſhall heale me of my blindneſſe, and thee of thy lameneſſe, in a ſhort ſpace: Could a poore blind creature encourage himſelfe againſt the fire, for the hope of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from his blindneſſe, and count a bloudy wretch a good Phyſitian in that reſpect? What ſhouldeſt thou doe then, for the hope of riddance from thoſe diſtempers, which have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thine inward peace, and have held thee downe all thy dayes till now? Oh! how good a Phyſitian ſhould he be, and how bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a medicine ſhould that be, that ſhould ridde thee from them?</p>
               <p>Secondly, how ſhould thy loynes bleſſe the Lord for this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> How precious was <hi>Eliſha</hi> to <hi>Naaman</hi> for his cure? how beautifull ſhould the feete of them be that bring glad tidings of peace? But eſpecially what experience ſhould this worke, in time to come, in all ſuch, as the Sonne hath thus freed? What
<pb n="852" facs="tcp:45715:341"/> Giant ſhouldeſt thou feare, having overcome the Lion and the Beare? What after births and paines ſhould affright thee, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eſcaped the chiefe paines of travell and birth it ſelfe? It is ſweete to thinke how ſtrong the Saints of God have beene, by this experience, and with what triumph they ſpeake of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. As <hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. Who hath delivered from ſo great a death, who doth deliver, and I am perſwaded will deliver! And yet who had ſuch after reckonings as he had? So often in ſpirituall deſertions, in ſoule-buffetings, in perils by land, ſea, enemies: he was much in labour, in travell, often ſtoned, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, perſecuted: yet (ſaith he) out of all theſe the Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered me; yea, and ſtill will, to his glory, till my worke be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: Thus the Church ſpeakes <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123. That if God had not beene of her ſide, the waves had ſwallowed her up: and yet God had broken the ſnare, and her ſoule was eſcaped. And what then? Our helpe (ſaith ſhe) ſtands in the name of the Lord. The poore lame and blind man in the Goſpel, being bidde to come to Chriſt, was heartned on by the ſtanders by: Be of good cheere (ſay they) the Maſter calleth thee: So ſay I, Be of good cheere, If when thou wert yet weake, and unable to helpe thy ſelfe, yet the Lord bare thee through, eaſed thee of all thy diſtempers, when thou ſaidſt, It ſhall never goe well: Oh! what ſpeciall lets by infidelity, feare, and tentation, what ſpeciall riſings up and bubblings up of corruption can he not ſuppreſſe in thee? Now he hath given thee ſtrength and experience by his promiſe, why ſhouldeſt thou diſtruſt him? One ſaith, What can ſeeme great to him, to whom the greatneſſe of the whole world is knowne? So, what can ſeeme tedious to him to overcome, who hath got the victory over his horrors of conſcience, and pangs of a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſullen heart through unbeliefe? Let us nouriſh this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience lively and effectually in our ſelves againſt ſtraits, either by inward deſertings, or outward enemies? Our Lord Jeſus felt both upon the croſſe, that we might truſt him for freedome from both: That Croſſe to which he nayled all Devils and men, enemies to his grace, ſhall alſo overcome all their ſecond aſſaults and affronts: and the gates of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt us, if we caſt not away our confidence. Yea, this our freedome ſhall be our earneſt-peny of that peace which the Lord ſhall ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon our conſciences for time to come: a pledge of that eternall reſt, which one day (when he ſhall cleare the coaſt from all tempeſts and blaſts of this world) with full ſerenity and calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the Lord ſhall tranſlate us unto hereafter. If this Angel ſtand by us, although we were in as deepe diſtreſſe as <hi>Paul,</hi> when no Sunne, Moone, or Starres appeared for fourteene dayes: we ſhall leape up (as he did among a rout of Ruffians and Souldiers) ſaying, I truſt God, that not one haire of our head ſhall fall to the ground. Oh! how well-pleaſing to God is it, that we give not over our hold, and caſt not away our Shield and Sword, when we have greateſt need of it? And ſo much may ſerve for this Uſe.</p>
               <pb n="853" facs="tcp:45715:341"/>
               <p>Laſtly, this may ſerve for inſtruction, to teach us the juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of God againſt all Hypocrites, who reject his Word, in this reſpect, loving their diſtempers ſo well, that they care not <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>7</label> for getting faith to be rid of them. The ſoule that longs for faith,<note place="margin">Inſtruct.</note> longs for peace, and riddance of ſuch ſlaviſh companions: but, they who withdraw from God, and will not beleeve, it is juſt with God, to leave them and their diſtempers together till they cannot be ſeparated. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaking of the people of his time, compares them to a ſeething pot, whoſe meat, liquor, and ſcum ſod all together, till they, with the pot it ſelfe were burnt all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. So it is juſt with God, that they, who would not have the precious ſeparated from the vile, ſhould have their owne faith ſtill; and be left to their ſtaggerings, unquietneſſes, falſe caſe, deceits and deluſions, and never be purged from their defilements. <hi>Peter</hi> excellently ſpeakes to this purpoſe, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.6.7. of ſuch as will not accept the Lord Jeſus to be their corner-ſtone of ſafety: Surely they find him a ſtone of ſtumbling and offence. So I ſay to theſe, Since you cared not to truſt in Chriſt, to ridde you of your corruptions, dead hearts, vanities, luſts, earthlineſſe, your unbeliefe, falſe hopes, feares, your owne affections and wayes: it is juſt with God to leave you ſtill to aſtoniſhment and anguiſh of heart: to ſinke and periſh, to fall and be deſtroyed, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 28. by this Rocke of offence. Chriſt is either a Rocke to ſave, or to cruſh in pieces. And I have noted that many Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees and Hypocrites, refuſing Chriſt, have turned cavillers againſt the way of God, complainers, murmurers againſt it, as baſe, tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and difficult, if not ſcorners and enemies. So much for this Doctrine and Lecture.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Entrance upon this 4 generall.</note>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough Brethren, at my firſt entry upon this text, I propounded no more Verſes of this Chapter to treat upon, ſave what I finiſhed the laſt Lecture: yet, this one day of our Lecture (being the laſt that you and I are like to teach and heare each other) and the laſt of our yeare, requiring that I ſhould ſay ſomewhat unto you: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo my ſtudies having reached fully to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Sermon: and beſides this fourth part of the Chapter, cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome connexion with the three other handled already: I have ſet apart this day to this end,<note place="margin">One point may give light to al the particulars following, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing 7.</note> if God permit: To wit, to handle ſome one ſuch point out of the whole Harmony of theſe five Verſes following, as may give you ſome generall light into the whole context: for time will not permit us to go through all.
<pb n="855" facs="tcp:45715:342"/> Theſe five verſes then, as I told you in their Title, containe the remoter conſequences of <hi>Naamans</hi> obedience. To give you a briefe view and taſte of them, theſe they are.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there is the true ſpirit of the cure to be evidently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this new Convert: feeling the truth of the Word <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in himſelfe, and virtue let out from heaven into Jordan to heale him, he takes it not as a common thing, and like a blocke without ſenſe: but is preſently, and inſtantly, and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtibly raviſhed as with a new ſpirit, begotten by the worke of God upon his ſoule, as well as his body. The Lord darting grace of mercy and compaſſion into his heart as well as health into his fleſh: (to intimate unto him, by whoſe, providence from firſt to laſt he was guided to ſo ſtrange an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:) Lo, he comes to the Prophet with a ſpirit of impotencie, admiration, and zeale, to acknowledge the Lord, with all fervor of ſpirit, and to knit his heart for ever in love unto him, for this cure of body and ſoule.</p>
               <p>Secondly, feeling himſelfe unable to reach the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he goes to his Prophet, the next inſtrument of his good, forgets his former diſcontent, and entirely embraces him as the Prophet of God, ſent unto him for this purpoſe: and to him he directs his thankfulneſſe, which fell ſhort of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee enters ſolemne league with the Lord, to be a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> cloſe client of his for ever: ejuring all former falſe and idolatrous ſervice, and vowing himſelfe wholly to the Lord and his worſhip for time to come.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he takes hold and poſſeſſion of the Church of God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> acknowledging it to be the onely true Church, and therefore ſcruing himſelfe into it; that although his face was <hi>Aram</hi> ward yet his heart was to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ward, and to the true and onely place where the Lord had viſible reſidence and preſence at this time. And this although he teſtified by a weake, and poore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, of taking with him the earth of the holy Land: Yet the inward ſoundneſſe of heart, exceeded his weake ſignification.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, he diſcovers his unfained converſion, by a moſt tender <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ſenſe of that ſin, whereby he had formerly moſt offended God: <hi>viz.</hi> his preſence at the worſhip of <hi>Rimmon:</hi> this darts into his converted ſoule, even as a daſh of the tooth-ach, or the ſting of an hornet.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, he is exceedingly pierced with feare and care, how he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> might nouriſh that ſparkle which God had begun in him: and how he might ſhun and prevent that rocke of offence, at which he had mortally ſtumbled before.</p>
               <p>Seventhly he is very glad to aske direction, while it was now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> to be had, how he might order his whole courſe for time to come, which being darke and doubtfull for the preſent, hee therefore craves the Prophets advice and prayers: unto which the Prophet gives him a mercifull anſwer. Theſe are the parcels of this fourth
<pb n="856" facs="tcp:45715:343"/> generall. I can but goe over the firſt.</p>
               <p>The point then is this, Where God workes a true cure upon any ſoule,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctr.</hi> Every true cure hath the ſpirit of the cure at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it.</note> there he alſo workes the ſpirit of the cure. By a cure I meane converſion of a ſoule from Idols, (not <hi>Rimmon,</hi> but) luſts and vanities, to the living God. By the ſpirit of a cure, I meane that inſtinct and diſpoſition, that due temper and quality which ſuch a cure deſerveth at the hands of the cured. And I ſay not, the ſpirit of him who is cured, but the ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rit of the cure, that is, ſuch a ſpirit as the mercy of him, that heales the ſoule, inſtils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, <hi>viz,</hi> to be for God, who hath beene for it. Onely this: As Gods cure hath beene gracious, ſo is the ſpirit of the cure zealous: and as his worke hath beene entire, whole and unfained to the good of the ſoule, that it might no more returne to folly, ſo is the ſpirit of the cure ſincere, intire, &amp; conſtant. God hates patchery, and halfe cures: and the ſpirit of the cure hates halfe thankes, halfe love, halfe affections. In a word, the ſpirit of a ſound cure of a ſoule, is a tender ſpirit: the very firſt fruits of the heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned with faith, forgiven, renued, and warmed in the wombe of mercy: the moſt naturall, peculiar, acceptable, and well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing fruit of the ſoule to God.<note place="margin">What the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a cure is.</note> It ſtands in a tender love (truly called the firſt love) a tender joy in God, tender compaſſions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, tender jealouſie of that which might provoke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im, tender care to pleaſe him, tenderneſſe of ſpirit both to him in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of deſire and delight, and alſo for him, in zeale and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, defence, and taking up armes for him. And it reſts not in him: but deſcends to a tender love to his Truth, Worſhip, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, Sacraments, Sabbaths, Servants, and all which hath any relation to God, even for his ſake. This in ſhort is that I meane by this ſpirit of a cure. I pitch upon this point the more willingly, becauſe it hath an eaſie comprehenſion of all thoſe ſeven conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the cure above named. And although each of them be diſtinct, yet becauſe this is my laſt Lecture, I am glad that one doctrine hath ſo good a lot as to give you (though but in generall, and farre off) a view of the whole. For in this ſpirit of the cure, all thoſe fruits of <hi>Naamans</hi> returne from Jordan, may be coucht toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a garment into one knot.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Explication of the Doctrine.</note>Marke then, for explication ſake, thus much. It is with the ſoule in point of ſpirituall cure, as with the body, in caſe of a bodily. Who being heal'd by ſome odde rare Phyſitian of a mortall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and ſuch an one as all the Phyſitians in the country could not turne their hands unto, yea ſuch as all others gave over, as deſperate, and paſt their skill: by ſome odde Phyſitian, (I ſay) one of a thouſand, who himſelfe could not have heald it neither, except he had by divine hand beene peculiarly made and train'd up for the very nonce to be skilfull in ſuch a diſeaſe: and ſuch a one as will by no meanes take money or fees, but ſcornes it, only ſtands upon doing good, preventing ſad wreck of the diſeaſed, that he might get himſelf a name of a mercifull and skilfull Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian: Tell me now, what man or woman is there living, who,
<pb n="857" facs="tcp:45715:343"/> having ſuch a cure of ſuch a Phyſitian, would or could, or hath the heart to turne away from him, like a blocke inſenſible and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th ſuch a favour? There is no ſuch man breathing, I thinke: But this is common: if any get ſuch a rare cure, all is too little to make recompenſe, though he ſhould ſell himſelfe to his ſhirt: he hath no power to do other, he thinkes the ſame evill would take him then. If he ſee that no reward will faſten upon the Phyſitian, but he will needs beſtow it freely, the more his purſe is diſcharged, the cloſer his heart is knit, his affections are up in armes, his tongue is looſed: Oh! what love is this? what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his heart thus to me? what a man of men is he? what admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration have I him in? O how I love him? what is there which I would not do for him? run, ride, ſpend for him? ſuffer for him, expoſe my ſelfe to any hazard, maintaine his quarrell by any weapon? O how he commends him, in all companies, and blazeth his name farre and wide, till he have raiſed up as great fame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, as reputation at home. Aske him why he doth ſo, he will anſwer, That I am, I am under God, by him: I was a dead man, worſe I could not be, he hath reſtored mee to health, and I am better (I thinke) then ever I was: and therefore I muſt alway count him my preſerver.</p>
               <p>I remember in the Roman ſtory I have read of a certaine ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle upon the Circk or Theatre of Rome, where (among other ſports) condemned perſons were to fight for their lives with wild beaſts; it fell out ſo, that a man before time paſſing through the wilderneſſe met with a lyon. And looking for no other then death, fell downe for feare.<note place="margin">An illuſtration of the point.</note> But the poore Lion approached to him with much moane, and held out his foote to the man, which foot of his, by reaſon of a thorn, or ſome ſuch like thing ſticking deep therein, had ſo rankled and ſwell'd, that it was like to hazard the lyons life: The man with all his Art and skill fell to his Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſo wrought that he pull'd out the thorne out of the Lyons foote, by the rootes. The poore beaſt feeling her aile and danger gone, fawnes upon the poore man, and makes all the love, that a dumbe creature could poſſibly, to him: leads him out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and there leaves him, and ſets him at liberty. It was the lot of this lyon after, to be taken, and to be ſent to Rome for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and it was the worſe lot of the man to commit a great Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery: and being condemned to the Theatre, to fight, what lyon muſt be brought forth to fight with this man but this lyon? The man all amort, and deſpairing of life, this preſerved lyon knowes his Surgeon, &amp; comes to him, fawnes upon him again, and by no meanes could be pull'd from the mans ſide and embraces, but to bring the man to mind of the cauſe, he puts forth his foot heal'd of the thorne. The people defeated of their expectation, turn'd their ſporting humour into admiration, asking the caytiffe, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſo marvellous an accident. The man publiquely opens the hiſtory, as it were wrought: whereupon cruelty being turn'd into aſtoniſhment &amp; pity, they decreed a ſtatue to be ſet up in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
<pb n="858" facs="tcp:45715:344"/> place (for eternall memory of the fact) of a Lyon embracing a man; over the Lyons head, with this title, Behold a Lyon, the ſaviour of a man: over the mans head. Behold a man the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian of a Lyon. I have beene too long, but the workes of God are not to be neglected; I would but ſhew you the ſpirit of a cure, even in a dumbe creature: what then is it in a reaſonable? But what compariſon is there betweene either and the ſpirit of cure in the ſpirituall ſoule and conſcience converted? Oh! no tongue can utter it, onely we may admire it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Proofes of the Doctrine. 1 In examples</note>Examples in our Saviours ſtory we have many of the ſpirit of bodily cures.

Hence are thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Saints, Thy Word was in mee as coales of fire in my boſome? Can a man carry them there, and not be burnt? I would have kept in thy words, (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) but ſuch was the nature of them that they would not be concealed: I had no reſt nor peace, till I had uttered them to Congregations. <hi>Peter</hi> could not hold Chriſt in his boſome, till he had uttered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to <hi>Nathaniel.</hi> That woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> had fire in her boſome when ſhe went to tell her kindred &amp; citizens the news of Chriſts diſcourſe. The love of God workes in the breaſts of his Saints, as it firſt wrought in his owne: he having conceived it once, could not ceaſe, till it had diſcovered it ſelfe to poore ſunken <hi>Adam:</hi> and hee would rather chuſe to make his onely Sonne a Maſſe ſhame, then he would not expreſſe it. Even ſuch is the ſame love, having once wrought in them: it is as the new wine in the caske, which muſt have vent or elſe it will breake.

                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.14.</note> and he muſt utter himſelfe to him, and fall upon his neck with a kiſſe and teares. The newer any thing is, the more forcible. So is it with love.

The word ſignifies,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.</note> gathers us up together: as a beaſt hemmed in a Pinfold, hath an appetite after liberty: ſo the ſpirit of love finds it ſelfe ſtraitned till it breake out.

Is the ſpirit of a cure ſeene upon them? Can any man ſay, that grace hath bred in them, tenderneſſe of conſcience, love to the people of God, a change of heart?

That pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and adoe which you have made to ſoder and play the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, might have beene better ſpent, and ſped better to purchaſe a ſound cure never to be repented of. Tell me, if a man that hath a dangerous ſore upon his body, content himſelfe with going to a baſe Quackſalver with a budget at his backe, and get of him a little ſalve in a clout to skinne his ſore at times, or a little water in a glaſſe to keepe it ſweet; will this prove a cure? Or if he go to a cunning Chirurgion, and he tell him, I can cure you, and make you as ſound a man as ever you were, but then you muſt be at ſome coſt, endure ſome paine, be content to be lanced, or to have your ſore ſearch'd to the quick, or to have the dead fleſh deeply corraſived, and then to be tented, and to be patient till it be quite healed: But then the ſore man ſhould ſay, Alas! here is coſt: I am loth to waite ſo long, Can you not bind it up for me the whiles, and keepe it warme, and the Ague from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it: if you can, Ile be content a while, and hereafter I will come againe! But, by that time, the ſore is gangreen'd, or fiſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or hath taken the bone and marrow, and the Cihrurgion tels him, it is incurable, his legge muſt be cut off, or it will coſt him his life. Would any man praiſe this man? Surely ſuch are many lazars cures, even ſuch as will make them creeples or bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ones. But ſound cures we heare of few. In the feare of God, take warning: All cures are not of one ſort: God can bee ſlight with the ſlight, and ſound with the ſound: Therefore come unto him, open thy wound, move him to pity, thou art but a dead man, if he helpe not; come, ere thy heart be quite hardned and paſt hope, confeſſe his skill, ſubmit to his cure, let him ſearch, tent, and handle thee as he will: If a ſound cure be thine aime, to get an heart truly purged of thy humours, broken, beleeving and repentant, know the Lord can cure thee wholly, as good cheape, as by halfes; renounce thy patchery and hollowneſſe, and come to plaine termes, and he can make thy fleſh come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as a childs. But know, that till then, no ſpirit of a cure will be ſeene in thee: nothing ſave a ſhifting, ſhuffling, doubtfull, darke, and ſtaggering courſe, will be come by. Onely this ſound cure will create a ſpirit of cure in thee, to be a zealous, humble, and cloſe Chriſtian, to be for the honour of Him who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered thee from death and hell, which no Phyſitian under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (ſave him ſelfe) could have done for thee. <label type="milestone">

Thou haſt felt the danger of loſing it, and the preſence of God to thy ſoule by it: If God have gathered it up againe, as water ſpilt on the ground, and gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up the loynes of thy ſoule with a ſecond girdle of renewed zeale and fervour of heart, lock thy doore upon thy beloved, clip him faſter in thine armes, then ever: and ſinne no more, leſt a worſe thing befall thee.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, this Uſe leads me to another and more weighty one of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>5</label> Examination,<note place="margin">Examination.</note> to try thy ſelfe about this ſpirit of Grace, whether ever it were wrought in thee ſoundly or not. There is no one thing within the whole compaſſe of Religion, more uſually counterfeited then this: neither is there any one point, in which either the deceit of the heart is more dangerous, or the ſoundneſſe of it more comfortable to the ſoule then this is. We read in ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that all brave Princes have beene counterfeited by ſyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants: <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth of <hi>England,</hi> and others: But although their outſides favoured them, yet their ſpirit diſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them at laſt: a baſe-bred fellow cannot equall the ſpirit of noble bloud. All <hi>Judaſſes</hi> and <hi>Theudaſſes, Acts</hi> 5. came to naught,<note place="margin">Acts <hi>5.</hi> end</note> becauſe they had baſtard ſpirits. There was once (as a <hi>French</hi>

And ſo may it fare here: ſuch are the apiſh imitations of impudent and unſuſpected Hypocrites, in point of zeale, devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, affections, and abſtinencies from ſinne, that the very annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God ſeemes to ſtand before him:<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.6.</note> Nothing in this caſe is ſurer to determine the controverſie, then the ſpirit it ſelfe of true breed and Nativity.

The ſpirit of the Grape will not be counterfeited by the fruit of a Bramble: the one is generous, the other baſe. Eagles breed no Crowes, nor Doves any Kites, nor Lions Foxes: No more doth the ſpirit of Grace breed falſe Hypocrites. Well ſaid thoſe ſervants, The envious man hath ſowne Tares, for the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman ſowed nothing but good Wheate. It will be an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible marke of thy true birth, if thine owne principle be throwne out, and if the ſpirit of mercy become that in thee, and unto thee, which thine owne ſpirit once was, even a ſecond nature.

                  </note> that it ſhall not reigne: A falſe ſpirit workes from within to an outward, but Gods Spirit workes from without to an inward operation: That is, Grace going out of her ſelfe, and ſuſpecting her ſelfe, both for the metall, and for the ſtampe, for the kind, and for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, for the quality, and for the continuance, abhorring her own ſparkes and falſe blaze, ſtill ſeekes out for a new ſpirit of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, a new frame of heart. But our owne ſpirit ſeekes within her ſelfe, what light, what affections, what imitations, ſhewes, and duties ſhe can finde out: never ſuſpecting her impotency to reach truth and ſoundneſſe. Now, although ſuch may goe farre with their Lamps a long time, yet at laſt, want of Oyle will make
<pb n="879" facs="tcp:45715:354"/> their lamps flagge: when their feelings ceaſe, when the praiſes of men faile, when ſome of their actions cauſe them to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, and when ſome right wind blowes full upon them, then they totter: when the winds and floods came,<note place="margin">Mat. <hi>7.</hi> ult.</note> the houſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded fell. By one way or other it muſt at laſt appeare, who are men of their owne ſtockes, and who are bankrupts; not to ſay this moreover, that a wiſe man well marking the Spirit of Grace, and comparing it with the other, will by one ſigne or other, eaſily diſcerne a Noble and true bred ſpirit from violent pangs, even at the beſt. But although he ſhould not, yet the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace will bewray it ſelfe in time, and diſcard the ſpirit of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>A true ſonne of faithfull <hi>Jonathan</hi> is a moſt precious peece to <hi>David,</hi> though a poore lame creeple,<note place="margin">

So one ſoule of the right ſtamp is more precious with God then a thouſand. Be ſure that the Word of the promiſe, that immortall ſeed of God, in the blood <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of a covenant, bred thee to the hope of life,<note place="margin">The Word of God is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall ſeed which bred it.</note> and the aſſurance of pardon, and this will turne all falſe principles of fleſh and blood, out of doores.

Deceive not thy ſelfe in this triall, which is very eaſie to doe, except God give thee an heart inquiſitive, willing to be reſolved, and earneſtly craving, that thou mayeſt not be deceived.</p>
               <p>Secondly, try thy ſpirit of Grace by the operations of it. As <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the principle is, ſo will the operations be:<note place="margin">By the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it.</note> 
                  <hi>Abiſhag</hi> may nouriſh

                  <hi>David,</hi> while there is any naturall heat left in him: but if that faile, ſhe can put no life into him. Adorne a dead King with a Scepter and Crowne, and all his Robes; Alas! it will make a good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.2, 3.</note> but all is loſt labour. Trie then what the fruits of that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are, which thou haſt: if they be ſuch as flow from an outward accidentall cauſe, violent and over-ruling, they will faile, when that cauſe ceaſeth to worke. But if thy hope, joy, and peace be from within, let outward meanes and motives either continue or ceaſe, ſtill thy operations will abide, and flow ſweetly, currantly, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully from thee. Water taken off the coales ceaſeth to ſeeth: yea growes colder, then at firſt. A ſive held in the water holds it as well as a bucket: corke held downe under water will ſinke as well as lead. But if the one be taken out, and the other be left to her ſelfe, all returnes to the old courſe. So is it here. A curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Philoſopher once framed an engine of metall, in the forme of a man, and brought it to ſuch perfection, that it could jabber and patter out ſome words: but one that beheld it cryed out, Oh faire skull without braines! As in mans body, all true operations of life and ſenſe, to move, to worke, to ſleepe, eate, and the l ke, come from a principle of life, and ſo ſerve the ſoule; even ſo here. Operations muſt not be the principle it ſelfe, but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to it: but if they be the principle it ſelfe, they are a falſe principle. He that commends a Preacher becauſe his friends love him,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24 16.</note> as <hi>Joaſh</hi> ſerved God, while <hi>Jehoiada</hi> lived, hath no love in his heart, and therefore may hate his ſervice after, as he did. He that cleaves to good company, to hearing, to profeſſion, for a van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his owne reputation, to get good cuſtome in trading, or a good match, or to ſerve his owne turne, or keepe ſome of his own heat, having no other Principle muſt needs turne bankrupt, for lacke of a ſtock of his owne. And the miſery of ſuch a one is,<note place="margin">Note.</note> That he heares, prayes, and worſhips, that he might heare, pray, and no further, from no hottome; and ſo his operation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes his principle. Of all ſuch wee may ſay, ſuch a principle will ſurely breed their ruine: either their eternall ruine, if no outward affronts intercept their courſe; or elſe both ruine here, and for ever, if croſſes come. For why? they do as a foole who commits himſelfe to the ſeas, in a broken Barge. When means faile, when Miniſtery ceaſeth, when it becomes a reproach to profeſſe, when falſe friends draw away the heart, when ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring for the Goſpell comes, loſſes, trials, and troubles, approach, then all Religion vaniſhes. No hypocrite can be above Gods ſtormes and tempeſts: eſpecially if a right wind blow, it will be turn'd up by the rootes. Every wind perhaps will not ſearch each rotten tree,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.</note> but ſome one or other will. The mind of the world ſearcht <hi>Demas:</hi> the wind of pride, and ambition, <hi>Diotrephes:</hi> The wind of ſecret luſts turne of ſome,<note place="margin">3 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.</note> the wind of affliction others: and the wind of time and continuance will ſearch deepeſt of all: for a ſtone can flye no further then the ſtrength of the hand which threw it, will carry it. Therefore be ſure, that the operations of
<pb n="881" facs="tcp:45715:355"/> goodneſſe which come from thee, proceed not from a falſe principle, but from the ſpirit of grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, trie this ſpirit of grace by the conſtituion and frame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> thereof, that is, by the ſoundneſſe of it. Unſoundneſſe of ſpirit,<note place="margin">Try it by the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ame &amp; ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it.</note> cannot reach that which ſoundneſſe can. For why? The beſt in an unſound perſon are his Negatives: reall, poſitive, and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall grace he cannot attaine unto. So farre as a negative way may go, an unſound heart may attaine. To ſide with religion as good, to deny himſelfe in many things for it, and to ſuffer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, from ſome confeſſed excellencie therein deſerving it, or ſome light reſtraint, example, or ends, may be an unſound hearts condition: but poſitively and really, to lay the honour of God to heart, inwardly to love, that he commands, to grieve for the ſin of ſuch as reſiſt it, inwardly to ſympathize the furtherance of it, that is beyond him; The reaſon is, becauſe his love is not from union, but from an adherence, or hanging by, in judgement, or pangs of affection. Take two examples. It is ſaid that two ſorts ſtrove for <hi>David</hi> to be their Kings: the ten Tribes of Iſrael, and the two other Tribes. There was more Negative ſpirit, in the ten then in the two: Why (ſay they) ſhould not <hi>David</hi> be more ours, then yours? we are ten, and you are but two: wee have ten parts in him: we can conferre more honour upon him, and give him more ſubſidies then you, and many good morrows. But whence came all this? from ſhame and pride, that they ſhould be back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder to fetch him home then the reſt; But the poſitive grace of love to <hi>David</hi> came from <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Benjamin;</hi> for why? he was bone of their bone, he was their fleſh: Nature ſtrove in them,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.43.</note> humor in the other; their words therefore were ſtronger then the words of ten times as many tongues of counterfeits. They (no doubt) made as great a brable, but geniall love could not be diſſembled. So it was in thoſe two harlots; pleading for the child: both ſpake earneſtly, neither could put downe other, in point of words:<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.26.</note> the falſe mother was as deepe in her Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive principle as the other ſeemed to be. For why? ſhe meant to be even with the true mother, and would ſee her childleſſe, as well as her ſelfe. So the living child might be divided, ſhe cared not: But by this <hi>Salomon</hi> deſcryed her. The ſword being brought, then that reall heart of a true mother appeared in the one, which could not in the other, for ſhe had it not in her. A wretch could be content to leave off all Religion, if he were ſure, that none would take it up after him: for he is good, becauſe it ſhall not be ſaid, but he will be as forward as any: But if none would be good, he could be willing to be naught: Why? for lacke of that habit and ſavour of grace, which makes the ſound heart deſire and reſolve to be be good, whether any other in the world be ſo beſides himſelfe, or not: The life of the child was ſo deare to the true mother, that (although it went againſt the edge) yet ſhe choſe rather the falſe mother ſhould have it, then it ſhould be ſlaine: And therefore it was adjudged to her as her owne. So
<pb n="882" facs="tcp:45715:356"/> is it here, A true heart would coſe any loſſe, rather deny it ſelfe to the death, then the life of religion ſhould be indangered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is bred in her boſome. So then you ſee (brethren) Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitives comming from life cannot be aſſembled by the heart which is dead and unſound. An hypocrite for his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour would have the the child religion into his poſſeſſion, for his credit, not for love of the life of it (for he will ſtarve and kill it, for lacke of good keeping;) only the true mother that bare it, and knowes the price of it, will nurſe and nouriſh it with her breaſts. Try thy ſelfe by this: Any Ape will imitate ſomewhat in a man, but he can neither laugh nor ſpeake for lack of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, trie this ſpirit of Grace by the object; Grace ſtrikes at the root;<note place="margin">By the object, the order, and equality there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> falſhood at the branches onely: The zeale, love, and grace of the ſpirit is chiefly, and mainly againſt the chiefe corruption of the heart, then of life: and it is firſt earneſt for the maine, moſt weighty matters of God, and then for ſecond things. Not firſt for the latter, and then for the former. Againe, it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, equall, not prepoſterous and diſproportioned. Great are the cries of many Separators from our Communion, againſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, abuſes in our Church: But you ſhall ſcarce marke any order in their ſpirits. They begin not at home, are not zealous againſt the abuſes of their owne ſoules, ſee not the pride, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate ſelfe-love of their owne hearts: The glory of God in their owne Reformation they will not looke at,<note place="margin">Separatiſts fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Church, how blind in the diſcovery of their owne corruptions.</note> but ſuffer themſelves to ſwarme with all baſe evils: ſee no want of Charity, Mercy, Compaſſion, Diſcretion in themſelves. If they would ſee their owne beames, they might the better diſcover others. But alas! if there were no Church abuſes to ſpeake of, their occupation would ceaſe. And why ſpeake they of theſe abuſes? Not (as becomes them) in patience, and innocencie, to wait for a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed redreſſe, but to overthrow the Church quite, and pull downe the very frame and foundations of it, yea to raze it to the ground: which never did any (of thoſe who are ten times more judicious then the beſt of them) attempt or intend. And ſo they bring an aſperſion upon others, to be as giddy and raſh as themſelves, who yet as much abhorre it, as they do thoſe abuſes. If the Spirit of Grace, of a ſound, humble, and tender heart, cleaving to the Word, cloſe to the Ordinances, could be found in them: If Chriſt and the worke of Faith and Regeneration, were as great objects in their eye, as outward adminiſtrations of the Church, we might hope better of their perſons, then now we can. So I might inſtance in other particulars. Many men have zeale &amp; affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in them, but how do they improve them? Surely not upon the reall things of the Goſpell, but upon perſonall objects: cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch as equal not themſelves, in their ſuppoſed grace, judging men for their ignorance, infirmities, errors. Whereas the ſpirit of Grace looks inward:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> it is mercifull, long-ſuffering, meeke, loving, hopeth all things, endureth all things: it judgeth her ſelfe in ſecret, and leaves others to ſtand or fall to their owne Maſter. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="883" facs="tcp:45715:356"/> the Spirit of Grace is free (as the Apoſtle ſaith) from all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and hypocriſie. A falſe ſpirit cleaves to this Miniſter, or to that, for ſome by-reſpects, <hi>Cephas, Apollo, Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 14, 4. <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.17 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22.</note> ſhall goe for his money: and accordingly is carried in ſuch affection, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times above the clouds, ſometimes lower then the earth, in likes and diſlikes. But a ſound ſpirit loves all the faithfull Miniſters of Chriſt, with ſutable tenderneſſe of heart, (though the meaſure be, as the peculiar relation ſtands) and holds the ſame affection conſtantly to all, for Chriſts ſake: The badge of their Maſter procures honour to them in his heart, whether old, young, neere, farre off, the gifts and graces of God (though lying diverſly) are the object of his love. Not only will a faithfull Miniſter be for God in Pulpit, but out of it alſo: not zealous in publique, and in private as another common perſon. A good heart will not affect a ſtrict cloſeneſſe upon the Sabbath, and then upon other dayes looſe or careleſſe in the duties of the ſecond Table: uſing all ſorts of companies, taking all liberties, breaking promiſes, paying no debts, running up and downe with neglect of calling and family: this is no ſpirit of grace, but of corruptiom, guilded over with ſome file of zeale, without ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the carriage of the ſpirit of Grace, diſcernes it from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ſpirit of unſoundneſſe: For you ſhall commonly find,<note place="margin">The carriage of it.</note> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a falſe heart will be as earneſt, zealous, and forward, as an honeſt: yet one fly or other of ſelfe reflection will bewray, whence it comes, even from pride and ſeeking it ſelfe. It cannot beteame and afford the Lord the cleere and entire honour of the action, except in the dreſſing it licke her owne fingers. As a rat behind the painted cloth, ſo doth falſhood diſcover it ſelfe herein. It is as oyle in the hand, which cannot be held in. If it be in a Preacher, you ſhall find it thus, Truly you muſt pardon mee, I was put to it upon a ſudden, but I truſt to your patience: &amp; why? Oh! to draw on praiſe and admiration! Oh ſaith another, I could not ſatisfie my ſelf in what I did! Another will aske, How did you taſte my doctrine to day? even as feaſt-makers cannot bid their friends welcome, be merry, but there muſt be a tang of folly, You muſt pardon us for our poore cheere, when yet they know they abound: ſo here. Others cannot bring forth a point, but it muſt be with a preface, I am to ſpeake to you of a ſpeciall point, and I doubt it will ſearch the moſt of us to the quicke,<note place="margin">Sundry miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of an unſound heart diſcovered.</note> a point that few of you have heard till now: and many there are ſo full of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that if they heare any man of worth praiſed for his worth, they are upon thornes till they can ſet another copie of their own by the other to blemiſh it. I was the firſt man (ſaith one) that firſt brought the Goſpell into the town; I was the man who hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out ſuch a drunkard, and brought ſuch an Adulterer to ſhame: I do ſuch and ſuch good to the Miniſtery, to the poore, and the like! I have ſuch reſpect in my place, do ſo and ſo in my family, and the like! Here's eagerneſſe, and zeale, but moſt unſavory ſtuffe mixt with it, too ranke for an humble heart to ſmell of.
<pb n="884" facs="tcp:45715:357"/> Let thy hints and overtures be for God, abhorre thine owne mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: nothing ſo oppoſes the true ſpirit of grace, as the ſpirit of a Phariſee, Lord I thanke thee, I am not thus and thus, I do ſo and ſo:<note place="margin">

Not that raſh oaths are to be admitted, in every ſolemne or ſerious caſe of truth: But partly for the ſettling of <hi>Naamans</hi> spirit, that he might ſpare needleſſe obtruſions, and partly, that he might know, it came f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>om no diſtaſt in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, but it was God who barred it. And why? Doubtleſſe the Lord would not that rewards comming from a Novice (whoſe ſtrength was ſmall, though his wealth great) nor any bruite ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of among Heathens (who muſt have heard of the fees, as well as the cure) ſhould diſparage and prejudice the grace and freedome of ſo miraculous a worke, as the converſion of a ſoule, and the healing of a Leper. And therefore he would have all ſuch ſiniſter conſtructions to be daſht: Gods Prophets never ſtand in ſuch deep needs, that God muſt be diſhonoured by their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. God ſcorned to be thought to ſend for <hi>Naaman,</hi> to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe his Treaſure, or enrich his Prophet: Teaching us, not to rake together boons and gifts from men, or advantages to our ſelves, counting all fiſh that comes to net: But wiſely to lay things together, conſidering what our perſons, the cauſe of God, the perſons that give, either unable, or ungrounded, or any other circumſtances may admit for the warranting or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the receit. For ſome caſes are too hot, and too heavy, to meddle with ſuch matters, tending to a ſnare, and therefore let them periſh rather then Religion ſhould ſuffer thereby. This latitude of giving and receiving, is not eaſily reſtrained, where Wiſdome and Diſcretion holds not the reine. <hi>And Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aman ſaid, Shall there not then be given two Mules load of earth to thy ſervant? For thy ſervant will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip no other God, &amp;c.</hi> A reply of <hi>Naaman</hi> to this refuſall, with his reaſon: Jn the former, he ſeemes to ſpeake thus, If thou onely aimeſt at my ſoules good, and not thine owne: hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to my motion, of <hi>two Mules load of earth,</hi> (that is, ſo much as will ſerve me to worſhip upon) for J heare that God will onely be worſhipped in his holy Land, or the bounds of his Church. This argued his weakneſſe: for God might bee worſhipped by true Proſelytes any where, though not in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.
<pb n="895" facs="tcp:45715:362"/> And, it was not ſo farre from <hi>Aram</hi> to <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Wonder not therefore, if the Prophet yeelded not. For herein be ſhewed himſelfe a Novice, and no wonder: Young beginners muſt be hatcht up and encouraged. But, for the thing which is to be noted, it is this, That in ignorant beginners, there are many tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable follies, and infirmities, inſeparably mixed, till better light and information ripen and rectifie them. There muſt be a time alotted for every thing and the Diſciples of Chriſt while he lived with them, were extremely weake: Chriſt being in his humility, they were bare: but after when he came to his Crowne, he gave them gifts abundantly. And we need not wonder if Popery after ſo long a ſoking in their dregges, are ſo ſtale and ſettled in their ſuperſtitions: when as, even at, and with the firſt onſet upon Religion, and creeping out of Paganiſme, this poore pilgrim here growes ſuperſtitious. When are we free from evill? Whiles drowned in prophaneneſſe, we are on the left hand, when brought to Religion, then a right-handed enemy invades us, Superſtition as a Canker breeding in the faireſt Apple of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to defile it Religion cannot quit us from danger. There is a white Devill as well as a blacke: Ignorance and weakneſſe being unable to avoyd many right-hand evils. Yet better (of the two) that our milke ſeeth a little over, then be eaten raw: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though both would be ſhunned. What a world of ſcurffe brake into the Church of God after the first three hundred years ſince Chriſt? Perſecution ceaſing, and Chriſtianity (under <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi>) beginning to proſper, how did Satan (hedged out one way) creepe in worſe another? We ſay, Out of the aſhes of ſinne, ſinne may ſpring up. Out of thoſe aſhes of perſecution, aroſe undue honour to Martyrs, Orations, Sepulcres, Prayers to God at their Tombes, Cenſings, and the like, till Superſtition without a word, bred Idolatry against it, and laid a neſt egge for a world of Popiſh traſh to enſue upon it. The ſad iſſue of it this day, argues of what ſtamp it is. Let us labour therefore to keepe devotion within due bounds, leſt elſe ſhe which was at firſt legitimate, after breed baſtards for lack of knowledge. And ſo much for this.</p>
               <p>The other thing is his Reaſon,<note place="margin">

<pb n="896" facs="tcp:45715:363"/> converted him, and no other. It is the ſame which is ſaid in <hi>verſ. 15.</hi> which gave occaſion to the laſt Lecture, proceeding from the ſpirit of his cure. It is (as I have ſaid) an instinct and inbred affection of all true converts, to clasp and cling whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the God of mercy, and to the truth of his worſhip, who hath accepted them to favour. And therefore the firſt reall conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and formall adjunct of his converſion, is wholly &amp; for ever to ejure Jdols. So that all defiled Schiſmatickes and Heretickes, Jdolaters, juſtly queſtion their true converſion. Jnto their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell let not our ſoules come.</p>

But they are much deceived. For the opening of his ſpeech, conſider there is ſomewhat in it good: ſomewhat doubtfull. That which was good was this, that out of a tender reſpect to preſerve his purpoſe of ſound worſhip, he ſmites firſt upon his chiefeſt feare, layes his hand upon the pained plat, and is most ſolicitous, for that ſinne which had beene, was like to be moſt difficult and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive in his way.

He is now in his chiefe heat and zeale for God, therefore to come in with a diſpenſation for a thing, contrary to his vow (in ſome kind) were very abſurd and unſeaſonable to imagine. But wee muſt conceive this verſe to containe the pith of all that had paſſed betwixt him and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha;</hi> touching his complaint J take it thus therefore, that here is a fight in <hi>Naaman, viz.</hi> betwixt zeale on the one ſide, and ignorance, doubtfulneſſe, and infirmity on the other. Having
<pb n="896" facs="tcp:45715:363"/> therefore (no doubt) debated with the Prophet, touching this great ſtumbling-block which was like to lye in his way, by his Maſters leaning upon him before the Jdoll, and the Lord (for the preſent) hiding from him the particular counſell, which he then needed: as a man not knowing what he ſhould do at the inſtant, whether to abhorre ſuch concurrence, enduring what ever ſhould enſue, or correspond with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Maſter: he breaks out into this paſſionate speech, that if it muſt be ſo, that for avoiding of ſome inconveniences, till God did further reveale himſelfe in that point, he muſt goe in and bow (which God knew how irkſome it would be to his tender heart, and derogatory to God) that then the Lord would diſpenſe with his weakneſſe, and doubtfulneſſe in that caſe, <hi>When I ſhall</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>goe in:</hi> he doth not affirme he will, much leſſe hath he delight and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in it: but if God do not betweene this and that occaſion, more fully reſolve him, that then he would not ſtrictly looke upon his act, but his intent. Neither is this new in Scripture in ſome caſes, that God tolerates for a time, that which is not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable in caſe of a strait, as in the midwives lie to <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> If any ſhall object, that he ſhould have renounced ſuch a concurrence directly, and made no pauſe: J anſwer, Who doubts of the Rule, That in Gods matters no deliberation muſt be admitted (as that holy Martyr ſaid:) But is this Rule ſo ſoone learned by heart, by a Novice which hath ſcarce time to conne his leſſon? No doubtleſſe, feare, and ignorance what ſhould be done in a caſe ſo difficult, and ſo ſudden, beſet his ſad heart, and forced this humble ſute to the Prophet, that looke what hitherto was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, he would be his mouth to God, to reſolve and ſatisfie his perplexed ſpirit in it when it ſhould ſeeme beſt. This concluſion J ſuppoſe the Text may well beare, <hi>When I ſhall goe,</hi> that is, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

All this, though it ſavour of ſuch weakneſſe and ignorance (as in a Novice, in a triall of ſuch conſequence is not ſtrange) yet I deny, that it ought
<pb n="898" facs="tcp:45715:364"/> to be conſtrued to come from a ſpirit of meere baſe colluſion and purpoſe to ſinne againſt conſcience. Now ſince the Text may admit ſuch a conſtruction, I demand, why ought it not? for it is a rule of interpretation, In doubtfull ſenſes charity muſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſway. And who knowes what light God might afford him, when he was gone from the Prophet? Sure it is by the Prophets fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well <hi>(Goe in peace)</hi> that <hi>Eliſha</hi> little doubted of it For to ſtill his anxious mind he bids him ſo do.
